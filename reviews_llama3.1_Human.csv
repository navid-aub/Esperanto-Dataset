Beyblade does not stick to launcher. Takes several min to get it to stick so you can launch it (if you can ever get it to stick). Very frustrating. Not like the Beyblades my son played with 10 years ago.
"I LOVE this journal. It fits into even my smallest square-ish purses, and the dotted structure instead of lines makes it perfect for drawing and writing. I found my first one at a store I can't remember, and I'm so glad I found this online. I just ordered two more."
"These are great looking, but the paper overall was not a hit with the kids.  I liked it for their mouths - seems like a healthier option than plastic straws.  But the taste is papery and tacky, and the straws quickly wilt when being used for liquid (!)"
"This is a great product, especially if you're not fully into traditional hyaluronic acid. I apply onto damp skin and pat in. Sometimes, I'll go a second time, too, right before other serums and moisturizer. It's been a life saver in the winter."
"These glasses were almost worthless for driving at night in traffic. They reduced the glare from horrible to almost-horrible, basically just enough to warrant putting them on at night. Beyond that, I didn't see any difference driving without them as driving with them. I honestly expected more."
"I got this long-handled litter scoop to use for my dog to pick up after her in the yard. Adding in on to a prime order, it was very cheap. It's a giant scoop and I don't think I need one this big, but I do like the long handle."
"I cannot believe Amazon is selling this set for this price!  My son loves these story sets and they are great for kids, easy for little ones to put together themselves. However, I bought this set for $4.99 from Toys R Us."
"Perfect for type 1 diabetics. I take about 2-4 tabs when low blood sugar during the night instead of going to the fridge and eating something that's not healthy. I keep them at work, in the car, and when going hiking. The grape is the best flavor."
"the design of these bags are amazing, spacious but light weight. so many convenient pockets, great for traveling or day to day use. thank you hot styles for always supplying the best! will purchase from again. cant beat these prices with this quality"
This pencil cup brightens up my desk while holding a large array of colored pencils. The design looks like an authentic antique map.The base is solid I don't think it would tip over easily. I question whether it would a remote or calculator as shown.
"I was able to speak to the seller via phone.  After an explanation of charges and fees, I feel I was  able to understand all items involved with this product.  I will be very comfortable ordering from them in the future."
"I love these earrings! They are so pretty, and sexy at the same time. I plan to wear these on an upcoming vacation and I can't wait! I don't have a ton of gold/gold toned jewelry, so I'm excited about adding these to my jewelry box."
"Works well.  I tested it on myself before the dog.  At least on the lower levels it is not bad, just enough to surprise him and get his attention when he is doing something bad.  The tone had no effect, nor did the vibration."
"This looks like a sturdy and fun toy for dogs who like tug of war.  Unfortunately, one of the two dogs in the family for whom I bought this has a partially torn ACL, so this had to be set aside."
I love the simplicity and natural look and feel of these variegated navy blue stones.  Navy blue earrings are tough to find and these were just perfect year round especially with jeans.  Loved them so much I got them in white.
This bowl fits the Good Pet Stuff Hidden Cat Litter Box perfectly as an additional liner tray.  I gave it three stars because of the strong rubber smell and I am not sure if my cat will be turned off by the smell and not use his litter.
"Love this collar... Thick leather, rivets flush no sharp edges.  The flowers stand out nicely and against my Great Danes blue coat they seem to float.  Hardware and stitching is quality.  Sizing is correct to the description."
"I got my package, The outside packing looked fine but when I opened it the baggie that held them was ripped and only contained 4 lanyards supposed to be 5.Also I think they could be a couple inches longer as they are a little tight going over the head."
Dogs like it so that's a plus. The bottle is so full that when you pick it up it just comes out of the pump until a few uses have been done and it's messy (it's oil)Dogs itch less it seems so must be working like it should
2 count of tan tape is 2 count of clear as shown in the picture. The description does not match. The bag with the tape inside is labelled tan though. Not sure where the disconnect is. Not much difference to me on the color...I'll keep it.
This is great ! Trapped a stray moma cat and her 2 kittens. This was perfect to keep them contained and gave them plenty of room. Bought 2 of them. I love this. And I think  was very reasonably priced !
They did what they needed to do. I wasnt able to use the clippers for the nails tho it wSnt strong enough and seemed like i was hurting my dog. Other than that the grindstone was good helped with the filing
The on button would not stay in place. Refurbished product was not fixed correctly from original owner. Epson said they could not assist because it was a third party purchase. Just didn't work out. Guess it's best to buy brand new.
I absolutely love this necklace as far as the design and overall quality of the piece. My only complaint is that I don't wear the necklace because it's feels heavy around my neck. It's nice to hang on my rearview mirror or other places.
This pack of party supplies was the perfect pack. It has everything we needed and more. The Mylar balloons were a little on the small size but the rest of the stuff was good quality and made of thick materials.
"I got this for an 11 y.o. Dog who generally prefers the floor to dog beds.  He loves this bed and uses it most of the time.  When he isn‚Äôt using it, our Maltipoo loves to curl up on it."
Item arrived quickly and in very good condition.  The price was very reasonable although shipping was a little high for such a small item.  Have not had occasion to use one yet so can't comment on how well it works.
[[VIDEOID:7d8106ecc60d3b532fd86febea373297]] The fountain itself is great! However I recommend that you don't put it in a room that you're in all the time. You can hear the running water sound constantly. Also they don't include USB wall adapter either. So had to buy an extra one.
"This dress is a great go to dress for work, date night or informal night event.  Easy to wear, it has a retro, classy look.  I have the green dress,  it is the most becoming of this style of dress."
"Works exactly as advertised! Clean to peel off too which was a worry.I have a couple cuts of this holding up light things vertically, and then a bunch of them holding all kinds of things from light to heavy from sliding horizontally."
Halloween! Three kid's love it and make their parents bring them back. Many parents take pictures or videos of their kids in front g it..8 have had it for about five years and the blower is getting weak so I was looking for a replacement.üòä Please find me one.
How disappointing!  I was hoping for a cupcake recipe a day.  Turns out most of the recipes are the same base vanilla cake with a different flavored buttercream or different decoration.  There are also quite a few muffin recipes - not what I would consider a cupcake!
It‚Äôs very very small. It‚Äôs cute and worth $10 I think... but one of my knobs was stuck and wouldn‚Äôt change the date! I was able to work on it for awhile and get it loose enough to rotate the date. It‚Äôs still difficult to rotate.
This product was useless to keeping my son‚Äôs cast dry in the shower. We had purchased a different one that worked great and needed one to fill in for a couple weeks before his cast came off and this was the wrong decision.
"the graphic is extremely blurry; it is not as clear as is shown in the seller's picture. you can barely read most of the words, which is really disappointing. it defeats the point of getting a mask that has catch phrases on it if you can't read the catchphrases."
I was very impressed with how everything was packaged.  Definitely Included everything needed for a small birthday party at home.  Table cloth was a tad short but we covered it with the amazing balloons included.  Would definitely recommend.
"Purchased these specifically for sleep and found that they do not remain in place for a full night. kept falling out. not comfortable for sleeping. ok for sitting.they were good for blocking out noise, but if you cannot keep them in throughout the night they do not serve the purpose"
Teepee is easy to assemble (almost effortless). Great quality and best of all...my little dog goes in it by herself. She loves it. I bought it hoping she would use it as a safe spot during thunderstorms. She relaxes/sleeps in it a lot!
"I ordered the wrong length of chain (my bad! I have a fatter nose than I thought!) but the piercings themselves are very nice, fit well and are comfortable.Will just order the next chain size up in the future üëçüèª"
Product arrive on time! I us to have one in my childhood it's nice to see this again. Its wider which is different. I didn't know this toy come in different shapes. Reminds me of barney in way but I'm grateful for this toy and the childhood nostalgia. THANK YOU
"This product is stiff and has sharp edges. Please buy the more expensive mat with the beveled edges. It came rolled up, so we had to place furniture and other items on top of it to get it to flatten out.. not worth it."
"Broken by a 20 lb. female terrier about three weeks new. The chinks are flat and thin.  Conversely, our $10 ones have never broken, they do not have flat chinks either, rather rounded ones. I know it seems unbelieveable because it's metal, I didn't believe the broken reviews myself."
I love this thing!! I have tested it alot of times and it comes out correct every time... Haven't miscounted yet... I use it once a week and it does what it saids it does... Great item and glad I pulled the trigger and bought the more expensive one...
These are the weird size needed for our security cameras. Great price buying in bulk this way. Disappointed in the &#34;case&#34; that was supposed to come with the batteries. It is nothing more than the clear packaging from the factory.
I am so glad that I ordered this! It really makes my beach decor! It is just the cutest and most cleverest invention. I call it my souls chef who keeps my iPad/cook book in its upright position!! Very well built and highest quality. Highly recommended!
I love the set and the look. But it is very hard to make good molds with if you don't have a pressure pot.  The mold creates air bubbles around the design that are impossible to get rid of if you don't have a pressure pot.
"This ID holder is a perfect storage for my phone, keys, and work ID. Daily, I wear the badge holder and I never forget my phone. Additionally, I can bring my phone with me into meetings and still look professional. I highly recommend this ID badge."
"I was not a fan of this.  I thought it was more like a flat chisel on the scrapper, but it turns out it was razor blades.  You can save money by just buying blades and not needing to buy this whole set up"
"These are very comfortable Viscatas and look good with any &#34;every day&#34; outfit. I wear them with jeans, skirts, informal dresses, pants. They are also &#34;well made&#34; , mine got wet in the rain a couple of times and look intact üëåüèº"
Like others have mentioned it is small.  Like really small.  It's a party favor.  I am not exactly sure how good of a product it is as my husband threw it away thinking the package it was in was empty.  Yeah that's how small it is.
I love this little face massager. It's so relaxing and soothing especially after a bath. I love being able to do my own treat yourself spa day at home. Works great on the neck tightening the skin and I've noticed it helping with my discolored skin.
"I am really enjoying this purchase so far. I really like the look and feel of it, and it is doing a great job of keeping my car clean! Easy to set up and I can see myself using it for a long time."
"This is better than any sticky roller, lint brush and even better than my chom chom!!! I pulled dog fur off of items that did appear to have fur on them! The pointed end is great for getting into the folds and seats on upholstery!"
They are small and cute little bookmarks. I got these for my niece to give to her teachers. She wanted to give them end of the year gifts. The sayings are nice. For us each one fitted an exact teacher.
The Easter bunny was really cute which is why I gave it one star but when I aired it up the first time to use on Easter for my grandkids it wouldn‚Äôt hold air. Very disappointed. I did receive a refund promptly though
"Play-doh squishes into every crevice and crack, impossible to take apart and clean. The weird play-doh plus is awful too. Crumbles and doesn't hold its shape well at all. Thankfully it was a birthday present and I don't waste my own money on it."
The first one I ordered was missing a piece so I got a refund. I liked the look and it's cheap so I ordered another. It missing a different piece.It's a shame because I really do like the design and price.
"The TecUnite 4 piece wood bookshelf ends were the perfect product for my needs. I wanted something that was unique from the standard metal bookshelf ends, I was not disappointed. Regardless the length of the bookshelf, they've held up well."
"[[VIDEOID:c3e3028700f1affe305dad14fc25e8e6]] I got the brown sets for my boys but the teacher said the blue one might be better.  I have no idea what's the difference at the beginning. But it seems like the Blue one has a reset key. And also bigger, it's easier to use."
"Nice knit cardigan.  It is very drapey and the material is thin, but not cheap.  A great summer weight cardigan.Well made for the price and xlnt color choice.  Order one size up if you want it roomy."
"Charm is elegant and just like the picture.  Chain is beautiful but gets caught in my hair while wearing.  Switched the chain out and can wear with no problems, too bad though because the original chain looks silky and smooth while on."
These planets are great for big and small. Little ones can get their hands around them and bend the arms and legs to different positions. Made well and good value for the money. They should last for a few generations!
"My pup has the most sensitive skin, she loves baths but it causes her to itch.  This is the best for her she washes up and no itching and she smells so nice.  Love it , and we will order more when we run out."
This is great post workout and before prolonged periods of low protein intake (e.g. before you go to sleep).  About 15 gr a day definitely helps you maintain muscle mass while trying to stay lean. Second only to protein as an important and (cost) effective supplement.
"I use these tubes when I'm doing my cleanses once every few months.  I put the mixture (maple syrup, lemon juice and cayenne pepper) in the tubes and it makes it really easy to transport for when I'm at work."
Got it just on a hope and prayer that it really might help and WOW it is so nice to have the pain and soreness in my feet gone.  I use it 10 minutes in the morning and same at night and what a relief.
Very cute nicely packed. My cat doesn‚Äôt smell well so It usually takes a while for my silly cat to realize something is food or toy or something is actually harmless. But he seems like touching and playing with this at least!
"[[VIDEOID:65875d681eb45e04af48fe30e811b8f4]] The book was in good shape, no pages seemed stuck or misprinted. Although there was a bit of rolling on the bottom right ( probably due to shipping üòë ) but other than that good quality and a good book for Any 5E player."
So affordable. And very versatile. Different ways you could teach children at different learning levels. Very fun and durable and the colors are so bright! I just couldn‚Äôt pass up the style either lol. I love them and so do my littles!!
They are in two parts. Which is awful. It falls off and makes so many spills in the laundry room. Had to hot glue them together to stop the constant spills. Unless you want to do some diy on these don‚Äôt buy them.
"Heavy, the template is flimsy and doesn‚Äôt help, needs to be cardstock.  Very heavy and only reacts to some magnets.  Was disappointed when my magnets didn‚Äôt work after all the trouble it took to get it on my wall."
"I'm using this lanyard for our annual high school teacher ugly Xmas sweater contest. I have to wear an ID, so this lanyard fits well with the ""Got Venison? (Santa roasting a reindeer on a spit)"" theme of my sweater."
"This suit was out of my color wheel of the types of suits I normally buy but this suit is really cute. The bottoms are a bit skimpy and I probably will not wear them, just wish they‚Äôd make them more like board shorts or give you the option."
This is the second one I bought.  The first one just gave out but I like the ribbon feature so tried it again.  Two months the retractable gave out again. For $18 it should last longer than 2 months!!
"I like that this is as complete kit for cleaning, but when you're selling an item in America, if think you would have the info in English... And not to keen on trying to figure out how to replace the scrub pad without the manufacturers instructions..."
"I like these pens a lot when I have a lot of space to write in. They write smoothly, consistently, and boldly, the boldly sometimes is a problem because again, not a lot of space = less words to write which is compounded by the boldness."
"I wear my Medical Alert &#34;dog tag&#34; all the time.. it does what it's supposed to do... It attracts attention, The engraving on the back is BOLD and easy to read.  This is also one of the most economic priced piece of Medical Alert Jewelry I have found."
"Fun-tastic  .. Christmas Gift and / or Decoration .. OR .. is it an Over-Sized Xmas Card .. Bedroom, Hallway, Den, Office, Break Room, easily good through age Pre Teen .. in any event this Auntie‚Äôs gift was a hit ‚Ä¶ Whew ‚Ä¶!!!"
"pocket doesn't close; right side strap is WAY too long and doesn't wrap nicely, so has to be cut; left side strap is supposedly slightly adjustable but doesn't stay adjusted; left side strap is twisted wrong so clasp is backwards.  ALl in all, a horrible bag."
"Good fit for SCX24 models. These worked as well as my MT tires. They are big. I had to upgrade to an Injora motor, which was overdue anyway. They assembled well.  Use locktite to avoid needing to overtighten the wheel screws."
Bought it for the foot rest.  Liked that your feet were separated.  Kept my feet comfortable on a long flight.  Nice to have my feet resting on something since my feet don't reach the ground on airline seats.
"These bands are pretty good quality. However, the they were too small for the first box I used them on (gloomhaven) and actually damaged the box. Worked alright for Twilight Imperium and smaller (seemed a bit too tight on TI)"
I am very happy with the product and the seller services.  I have used this Vita-C serum mixed with my Clinique moisturizer for several years.  It is GREAT to see it available on Amazon with quick shipping. Thank you.
I love this product because it is easy to put on your dog just slide the front legs through and also there is no way impossible that your dog can get choked by this harness love it would buy it again.
Great office chair!  This was easy to put together and easy to adjust.  I use it working from home everyday and it is very comfortable.  It does recline and rock some but I do not use that feature.  Highly recommend!
I bought enough of this to make two batches of what I was using it in.I was grateful for the packaging choice. The leftovers store well.Only 4 stars because I wish the pieces were larger like full slices of it.
"The quality of these Neca Predators is amazing. The detail is fantastic. If you don't intend on taking them out of the box the. Be cautious, because three of the ones I ordered the box was damaged a little. But as for myself I bought these for display/photos."
These are exactly what they say they are. They roll awesomely and looks great. I always get compliments when I lay down the damage. Only complaint is that the crab is a 1 and not a 6. Would be much cooler if the 6 was the crab.
Only here to comment that you can get this off love honey website for 20$ and under... whoever is selling this is ripping ppl off big time!... but the you itself is amazing... quiet and gets the job done quick üòâ
"My son's friend suffers from Celiac so having GF products labeled clearly is very important.  I slap these on every item I am sure is GF, twice! I even purchased a roll for her to keep. I love these. Easy to see and they really stick!"
[[VIDEOID:2aa7d9f60b64e2d178f212f25d434cfb]] There are so many cute designs of the slap bracelets. The zipper bracelets were my favorite and I wish there was more of those. These are definitely going to make the kids happy when they open their goodie bags. 10 out of 10 recommend
My grandson loves this little train! It‚Äôs a small and easy set to setup. He didn‚Äôt under the red switching piece so we took it off and the little engine travels around the circle and on the track just fine. It‚Äôs the favorite toy in our house at present.
This mask is not quite as padded as the Sleep Master mask but it is larger and provides a lot of coverage. It has good amount of velcro but not too much. It's a good alternative as one of the top sleep masks out there.
We only use one button. We might use another. The treat and food buttons are not good ones to introduce early on to dogs that are treat and food motivated. Different options would be better for a starter kit in my opinion.
"As far a super bright oranges go, this is probably my favorite of the ones I have tried.  Performance is great in a variety of nib sizes and on many different types of paper.  There is some nice shading in broader nibs as well."
I loved the earrings. I was looking for a lot of pairs of earrings for my new earring holder and I was in love with them. You get the value for your money. Super cute and light weight. Super fashionable as well.
I'll admit that it was smaller than I had anticipated but my baby loves it. The sounds it makes when all the parts are inside and the different bright colours makes it a wonderful gift. Plus it really helped with the grabbing reflex that translated to grabbing food well.
"I use this to hold locks while I practice lockpicking.  I needed something sturdy and this really fit the bill perfectly! I'm sure it is sturdy enough for hairdryers also. The clip works well, and the arm grasps really nicely around round objects."
"I like it.  It is made of fairly cheap materials, but it was cheap to purchase.  It fits the watch perfectly and I use it in rotation with the other bands I have.  A big plus is that it fits (barely) around my nearly 9&#34; wrist."
"I order this for a decoration, and it was much bigger than I expected so no complaint there but being so big it's not as bendable as I would of liked. You can't make it sit down which was my plan but it stands just fine on its own."
"These are small enough to fit into my tiny purse or in my car. When I step into sunshine, suddenly the cat fur is visible. No tape to melt or dispose of. Just swipe on way and clean off the other way!"
"My neck is 15 and a half inches, and this will not fit. Plus, the fabric is too narrow for the velcro to fit, and the sharp velcro cuts into my neck, rendering this a not suitable support for a man."
"Nothing bad to say about this Excellent for the Price. I'm even using it to weight myself (under 200 lbs) because my bathroom scale is POO.  Anyway, easy to read, easy to use, built like a tank. I love it."
"I go through a lot of book tabs. They are so useful, but they tend to be pretty expensive and not great quality. These tabs are different. They are really good quality and there are so many! I also love that they are transparent! The price is great, too!"
"Shirts cute and fits like a boxy crop, the sleeves could be a little longer and tighter tho.. the main issue is the stripes are dark blue not black like the photo and than the sleeves are black so it‚Äôs misleading but still cute"
"Replaced another that I dropped several times and finally fell apart.  Fits nicely in shirt pocket, holds hearing aids, spare batteries and filters.  Looked at others online, they did not appear to hold enough stuff yet be small enough for a pocket."
"My niece wanted this for her birthday and she loved it!  It had plenty of extra rhinestones leftover.  The only downfall was that the purple marker was dried out, but for the price and the fun she had doing it, it was money well spent!"
"Neither black light worked. Only one light lit up unlike it shows in the photo. I am sending it back for a return and am going to try one more time. If the product is broke again, I will be returning and buying elsewhere"
"The cap had a crack in it. For the price you pay it shouldn‚Äôt come with a crack. It does not write as bold as you see in the pictures either. Nice pen to hold, love the big barrel of it. That‚Äôs why I gave it 2 stars."
"I‚Äôm not one to leave reviews but I have to with these cards! AMAZING QUALITY! Sturdy, thick, easy to read and vibrant! Numbers 1-20 w pictures on the back for counting, A-Z w pictures, colors, and shapes! LOVE LOVE LOVE!"
I bought this for my grandsons birthday. It is easy to put together . However the clamps are not sturdy . I put it on a regular white table and it would not grip right . I would not buy this again
"I wear this style of glove almost daily in winter for farm work, I have tried many brands dollar tree, Walmart, etc. And I believe these are the best, they are softer and thicker than others while still being thin enough to leave me with enough dexterity for my work."
We had a dragon party for our five year old and these little dragons were party gifts for our guests. The kids loved them and were so excited to find them in the gift baggies. I feel confident that this was a good purchase.
"They may be comfortable to wear, but I don't care for the wide ankle, or the  fabric.  I don't feel they will wear well.  Unfortunately, I didn't know how to return them, so I ha d them altered.  It will not be a repeat purchase."
This is a pretty sticker but much smaller than I expected. As you can see in the picture it‚Äôs probably a little bigger than my thumbnail. I was expecting it to be bigger but they do give you a good quantity.
"BEAUTIFULLY-MADE!  The picture doesn't do it justice! Seems very sturdy, but also comes with a lovely little velvet-like bag to carry it in.  I love the stones and the fact the cross is pewter.  WOULD HAPPILY use this vendor again and intend to!"
"Im really impressed with these for the price! Im in charge of birthdays in my office and needed something cheap but also still cute and these are it. I appreciate that all the cards are different, no two are the same."
"It looks like it would be baggy from the picture, but it fit me perfectly! The extra room fit right on my hips so it was slightly form fitting without being tight at all. Perfect to wear with some cute leggings if you're having a comfy day!"
"These are just enough moisture not to leave a thick wet layer to be wiped with a microfiber cloth.  I use first one each of these to clean my two pairs of eyeglasses, which I finish up with a microfiber cloth.  The result is crystal clear."
"My 5lb Pomeranian is shedding her puppy fur EVERYWHERE. I don‚Äôt mind everywhere, except my bed.  She have a big lollipop head in this PJ. Super cute. Also, less fur in my bed. This is super soft, made with good quality, stretchy fabric and easy to put on."
These were handy for labeling my elderly mother's clothes that get washed in a memory care facility that tends to get resident's clothing mixed up. I know that her clothes always get back to her eventually.  The staff appreciates the labeling and wishes everyone's items were labeled.
"A decent timer/button.  chief complaint is the alarm volume is very low and easily missed with any conversation at the table.  If you're having a party, be ready to have some other timer so you can hear it."
"I used these for my 5 year old's bday party.  The kids had a lot of fun and the crayons worked well for application.  However, the colors rubbed off very easily and didn't last even until the end of the party."
"ALWAYS READ DETAILS.  I did not this time, and I regret it.  This set up is way to small, but I tried it anyway.  It didn't last anytime as I suspected, plus it didn't cut the leg hair at all."
A couple of wipes to clean the lens and UV coating rubbed off. I am a sunglass connoisseur so I know how to clean glasses. What is weird I have yellow coated ones and they are good to go after many cleanings? Stay away from blue coating....
"I have to revise my previous review of this pet bed mat. It didn't hold up well with my 3 & 1/2# Yorkie. The bottom has a very thin material, and it completely wore out, exposing foam. I had to throw it away. My Yorkie wasn't rough with the bed."
These keyboard and mouse wrist supports are comfortable -- soft yet firm enough to support my wrists. They make typing and mousing much more comfortable. I expect to get a lot of use from these since I am often on the computer.
"I bought this because it is black, low profile, simple design, cheap, and shipped free to Hawaii. It's a good jersey. I'm 6'1"" 180lbs and order the XL. It's roomy and breaths well. i should have gone with a large though."
We have an AussieDoodle puppy who is still getting used to all things grooming. These were perfect to help with her feet and back side. Quiet enough to not scare her and very easy for us to use. Love the color too! Would definitely recommend.
"....well maybe when she comes home from the groomer! But, this is the product if you want to get close to the same results at home. We bath every week and this product isn't irritating yo the skin. Love the smell, too!"
"actually the problem was, the two pieces were mis-cut!  one was larger than the other, so it never looked right, and well.... the way it draped made it look ridiculous.  is there no such thing as &#34;quality control&#34;  or &#34;integrity&#34; ???  ZERO STARS!!!"
"Unless I am confused about this set, I am talking about the 36 Grasp Washable Fiber Color Pens.  They are wonderful colors, but very wet and soak the paper and leave it lumpy like stucco.  This is not at all what I expected."
"We got a number of costumes from several vendors for our 5 year old grandson's birthday present. This is his favorite, and it was worth every cent to hear his 2 year old brother yell &#34;yee haw&#34; when he saw it."
Worked very well for my son who suffers from severe overpronation.  Replaces current shoe insert and provides elevated arch support for flat feet pronators.  Comfortable support.  Run a bit small.  Purchased the 12 size even though he is a 11.5.
Affordable and effective. I have been very happy with these compression sleeves. They fit well and have helped me in preventing shin splints. I would definitely recommend these if someone is looking for a sleeve that won't break your pocket book. Very happy with this purchase.
"All 3 of my cats share the bed as its large enough for all 3. Its soft, weighted and made of good quality materials. I ended up purchasing two of them due to the enjoyment that my cats get from these beds."
"Fantastic!  I love this item because it really does keep me pain free.  It is easily portable, but I keep my cushion in the car, so whether I am driving or in the passenger seat, I know I will be comfortable."
I like the material it‚Äôs breathable however it was really long from the bottom I bought a large since the reviews advice to do so but I guess I‚Äôm to short ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è? Anyways it was a good product but was way to long
Super cute slippers. They are a little thick. I might have tripped a few times while wearing these. But once you break them in they get better. Still cute and comfy.  I have noticed some shedding. I wear around the house so they work for me.
Works awesome for watches but as mentioned you really need a dremel or rotary tool.  Gets 5 stars from me as it worked for its intended us.  Tried on an iPad screen and definitely ruined it though ha.  Think the glass materials may be different.
Back cover came completely off the spiral before I even got through a single month of it. Highly disappointed as this has one of the best calendar and note sections I‚Äôve seen in a calendar pad. Not happy with it at all
I have used this for a week now during my commute in NYC. Helps my indoor (less sneezing) and outdoor allergies. It doesn‚Äôt weigh much & you forget that you are wearing it. The seller is also accomodating with our questions.
"I like this one because lately I only found the ones without the holder. I have shorthair and really straight, so I really appreciate that it has the holder so it make it easy to make the curls. Nice quality"
"I love this mouse pad, it is adorably cute and is well made.My only issue with it, whatever this material is made of, has an odd smell and for the first month will rub off onto your hand when you touch it."
These things are definitely too expensive but that‚Äôs the new trend for the kids I guess. This one is awesome though spins a really long time and is super hard to burst. Kid was really happy with it since he beats all his friends with this one.
I was skeptical to buy this when my son sent me the link requesting them. Since they were so inexpensive I went ahead and got them hoping they weren't too cheaply made.  He wears these more often than his Nikes and they've lasted longer!
I've never had to use the electric zap...just the sound and vibrate...now weeks later...if he has it on...he won't bark!  Got a second one for his little sister...and she immediately know to stop barking....They are GSDs so very smart.
"I bought this for my 97 year old mother's arthritic hands. We've spent a fortune at drug stores on over the counter remedies, which were pretty worthless. This is the second Muscle Stuff I've bought for her and she loves it. Highly recommend."
"Excellent product but receipt of the ordered product, Ostinol Advanced 475, has become inconsistent. Have received Ostinol Advanced 450 or regular Ostinol 450 instead of my order of Ostinol Advanced 475 with no notice or explanation. Not eligible for return"
I like that this toe splint is hardly visible. It's relatively comfortable and keeps my toe stable. Works better when you wear a sock or pantyhose over it to keep everything in place. Can be trimmed if needed. Recommended by my foot doctor.
Bought this for my grandson. He‚Äôs now 22 months old. He‚Äôs had it a month and loves it. He  literally plays with it all the time. It‚Äôs a great size for him. Very soft and definitely worth every penny. Highly recommend.
"I needed white pants for a class - thought these would be simple and seemed easy to care for. Pants are NOT white, but beige. Comfortable, high waist. Washed well but overall not what I expected, as they are described as WHITE."
"Second to none! I have tightness and discomfort in my knees whenever I attempt heavy power cleans. Today, no discomfort or tightness. Very comfortable and great material. I highly recommend these knee sleeves. You will not be disappointed. Great sleeves and great customer service!"
"I expected it to be a bit sturdier.  Also after 2 days of using it the zipper on 1 side broke, i was very dissappointed about that and the tassel broke off from the other zipper.  The snap does not snap."
Unfortunately my pet rat nibbled at the corner and chewed threw the material just below the hanging clip hook.  Now it hangs by 3 hooks.  So it's not so sturdy and it's easy for the pets to chew through.
The product description is pretty accurate. It only holds two keys but is sturdy enough to turn the ignition. And that's what I needed help with. I'll figure out how to link my other keys and fob since big issue is solved.
I won‚Äôt purchase items that charge more for the smaller sizes. It‚Äôs messed to make people who don‚Äôt need as much fabric to pay more because it‚Äôs in higher demand for thinner people. Seems like that‚Äôs an issue for the manufacturer or the seller. Not the buyer.
Second dress I tried from this brand. Their styles are cute but the material is terrible. Stay away. The fit is true to size but the dress sticks to your body from static and in the summer it will probably suffocate you.
"Although it technically fits my norelco trimmer as advertised, the mechanism that moves the blade doesn‚Äôt really fit, which causes the Trimmer to vibrate much slower than when using the original blade. I plan to stick with my original blade."
"Bought this for a trip to Greece and Paris, but never used it because I jut used the travel purse I bought.  I'm giving it to my 20 y/0 daughter that doesn't always like to carry a purse into clubs, etc."
I love this dress!!  It‚Äôs adorable on.  Price was great!  Quality is spot on for the price.  I see my self wearing this dress time and time again.  I could even add a open sweater and booties and wear into the fall.
We always decorate our entire outside in spider webs and I am very particular about how they stretch so that they look more real. These were much thinner than I would prefer and were not as easy to put up. They are easy to rip apart because of that though
"I use kneaded erasures for my artwork.  It's an essential tool.  I teach oil pastel techniques. Nothing works as well. Prismacolor kneaded erasures are the best on the market.  These were small, even though the box said medium, but it doesn't take much to do the job."
Not quite the desired results.  If the sun does not hit your ball ...it's not going to come out with theses glasses.  And anything that reflects the sun - even leaves- will glow so you find yourself taking them off and on alot
"Best part was the quick delivery.  Overall the product was fine.  The wheels don‚Äôt quite roll as nicely as our old ones, don‚Äôt know why.  All in all glad that I was able to salvage the chair"
These are the BEST lens cloths.  They look great & work extremely well.  The artist pictures on the cloths are an added touch of fun in an otherwise mundane task.  The customer service for this company is wonderful.  Highly recommended cloths.  Well worth the price!
I bought this for my 4 lb cavapoo pup. The fabric is very very thick. The fit was very snug on him and I could tell he was getting really hot from wearing this so I immediately took it off and am returning :/
An &#34;ok&#34; checker set. Metal board is nice but the checker chips and marbles are very cheap plastic. Very unhappy with the plastic marbles. Nothing at all like the good 'ol classic I remember from childhood. Was hoping to pass on this favorite to my kids but sorely disappointed.
NOT for big cats! The space for the litter box is too small for a standard size litter box and my cats ended up peeing the box because they didn‚Äôt have enough room. It looks nice but I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt return it now.
"I would rate rate higher but the tag fell off after a short period of time. It was a nice design and looked solid, then poof it was  gone after ~2weeks. I would assume it was probably the metal ring holder that broke."
"Giving 3 stars because toy lasting still,my mini pin usually has toy destructed in a day.as for spray.its useless been spraying chair  on bottom where she chews insides and it still has not stopped her chewing?? Been over 2 weeks with me spraying at least every other day."
I was given this book from a class I took for Pre-Diabetes. It was very informational and thought a friend of mine could also use it to help her diabetes. Although this book was in the smaller format. You would definitely want the larger format.
"Wow !! Just got this and it fits and looks awesome!! I'm 5,9''- 175lbs and the small size fits perfect..design, Zipper and button color, and leather look really cool.. Very vintage underground look.. Biker meets Indiana jones style...very very happy"
These work just as well as any name brand label I have used in the past. They work with the Avery label reference and are a fabulous touch for any DIY crafter. I have already purchased more. Would definitely recommend.
"These peel and press sticker pictures are so much fun, and they really are pretty when completed. They don't take a huge amount of time to finish, which is good, so the child doesn't lose interest. My eight-year-old granddaughter loves them. They also make a great gift."
"I have used every cream and rub available for my chronic muscle spasms, until I discovered this product.  It is a total game-changer.  The ginseng nourishes the muscles, causing them to relax.  I am just grateful, and lucky, and blessed with these patches in hand."
I just don‚Äôt like this book-marker. The magnetic part is too thick and awkward. The planner I had it in doesn‚Äôt close correctly with the book-marker in it. I took it out and I‚Äôll probably use it as a cat toy now.
"Our little dogs really like these, and I haven't seen any adverse reactions with their stools.  Of course we don't give these daily, as we have chihuahuas, and don't want to over fill their stomachs, and then they don't eat their regular food."
They are not normal bandanas. They are a triangle shape rather than the traditional square shape that you fold diagonally. They are also a stretchy material and not very vibrant in color. The print on the fabric is also one sided.
Do not waste your money. This item doesn't eject the balls for the dog to automatically play. Ball isnt tossed at all and simple falls out.of the hole. No entertainment what so ever for my dog. The dispensers also isn the greatest.
"This Adjustable Ski Mask is soft, breathable and comfortable, it's also lightweight, can help you keep warm in winter days, good for skiing, fishing, hunting etc. outside sports. But it always go down even I tight the strap, especially when I play golf in cold days."
"Taste really good to me. I have been doing keto for a while though. A great break from your regular protien bars. However, I have noticed that I have a slight weight gain when I eat these. Not sure if it raises my blood sugar or not."
The price is great for these lanyards that we'll use for facemasks. One out of 30 lost a rope clamp and snap clip. The clips are small and not easy to fit cloth masks but work well with disposable facemasks.
"Fits well, can we adjusted for a tighter fit.  Bought mine for a t4-t8 injury, it's helping but I need something with more support.  Would be perfect if not for the area of my injury and what I specifically am looking for."
Took ten minutes to assemble. Needs rubberbands (included) to keep it together. Tons of plastic waste on packaging. Not as nice as other product that costs $8 more. Spend more on better product unless you don't care about my points. Still a functional product for now.
"The overall look is cute, but they come with drawing instructions that don't coinside with the contents. Is it rocket science? No. But you definitely have to follow exact photo or else the pipe cleaners don't really work. The kiddos thought they were cute. Me? Eh."
I use this for work to keep track of meetings and other steps of the design process. VERY handy - I can write on both sides of the page with heavy ink without bleed-though. I wish they would include page numbers...
"We have a bulldog mix, she weighs 55lbs the outfit fit perfectly.  Was gonna post the size but it's not on the tag or label on package.  I think it was size large. Great Quality!! Our dog actually likes it!"
"So this paper works as advertised, we like it for our D&D maps as you can print a really nice map on it and use dry erase marker that wipe off with a little water and paper towel but not really worth the price."
Seems to fit on my feet although my size is 9 but have to buy size 9.5 instead due to inavailability but it doesn't look too big on me. I haven't tried it to walk far but it seems it has good enough tracking on the sole.
"For the price, it‚Äôs a great product.  Expect more fashion than surviving a blizzard with this, but it‚Äôs cute.  I‚Äôm actually using it as part of a Halloween costume, but I could see using it this winter too."
I was looking for a folder that was both durable and cute and I found them in Semikolon's Striped Folders. I have shoved these folders into my work bag and they stayed in good condition. There was some bending at the corners but overall I have been very pleased.
"Great value! I've bought them in every color. Very stretchy - will fit any size.  Adjustable straps are slightly itchy on my back, but not bad. Nice and thin for wearing underneath clothes.  Wouldn't wear by themselves. No shelf bar."
Fit and cut were fine.  Unfortunately the material was so thin any dress I would pair it with you would see through the pattern.  I had to return.  Loved the style just not the material.sgamr it was cheaply made.  A liner would solve all of that.
My vet recommended and my dog uses regularly.  Grace had some immune problems and these are just one the supplements she takes that has brought her back to good health.  Small and easy to take apart if you like to sprinkle on their food as I do.
"My dog LOVES this food.  if i mix this with kibble, he picks the kibble out and spits it out and only eats this.  He loves this food, it smells good, and it looks nutritionally sound.  And from what my vet says, it is healthier than kibble."
"These cod livers are sooo good.  I couldn't wait try them and they didn't disappoint.Next to lobster tails, I've never tasted anything so GOOD in my life!EDIT: 12/28/2019I'm taking OFF 2 stars for the SMASHED UP CANS YOU KEEP SENDING ME!"
"Great idea for bracelets but I received the gray one when I thought it was black.  Don't like the gray color but neat idea for changing out the snaps.  Snaps stay in place, no worry about them falling out."
This water flosser is good value for the price. It‚Äôs approximately half the price of a Waterpik so it‚Äôs very affordable. I use this in the shower and it has been working out well for me. Will update if anything changes.
"I have started making my own natural hair products, and this is very useful. It is small but the right size for why I purchased. This way my herbs and spices do not loose their effective properties, due to direct heat."
Terrible!  Very cheaply made.  I don't know what the people who say this is high quality are thinking.  It clearly is NOT quality.  Quite the contrary.  It really doesn't even work or not very well. It's noisy.  It's junk.  Don't even consider it.
Bought this for my sister who loves cats. She couldn't;t stop laughing when she unpacked it! The small-medium fit her but she is a petite girl. Read reviews where the eyes wash out after the first washing cycle but so far so good.
"I returned the earrings because they were too small for what I wanted.  I did think they were beautiful, and excellent quality.  I just needed something larger that would be a good accessory for my son's wedding and these were only about one inch in length."
"*My Daughter's Review*: They are a great size/not too bulky and very clear. Helped increase balance. At the wedding she was a bridesmaid in, they fell off in the mud several times although they were the correct size which caused her to almost fall/got her shoes dirty."
"I got those cool bath bombs for my kids. They had a blast with this unique shaped bombs. Those bath bombs are actually bigger than the others on market, so its a lot of fun for the kids. The smell is a hit!"
"Love that this looks sturdy, all around. Sadly, for me it also looked like someone returned this particular one to Amazon & they did not look inside. Deep scratch and some soiling. NOT seller's fault - just harried workers in returns. Would purchase again & probably will"
"These toothbrushes aren't as sturdy as I would like, hence the rating.  It has an uncomfortable grip and too small of a head.  Since I purchased them in quantity I'll use them up and them replace them with another brand."
High quality material and the shirt fit perfectly.  The head cap had some excess material in it but I guess it all depends on the shape of your head.  This was the easiest Halloween costume I've had and it still received lots of compliments!
"This is a nice medium to dark brown. The ink dries fast and doesn't bleed, feather, or fade upon drying. I'm still on the lookout for a deep dark brown, but this will definitely be my go to brown until I find one."
Tokara said let's make a combiner out of Optimus which is a good idea but because of Optimus this is almost 400 dollars which most of the combiner sets are but still it's really doesn't feel like a 400 dollar figure
Product looks nice and more expensive than it is from afar. Up close it‚Äôs a little more obvious that it‚Äôs not real silver. Bought them for my bridesmaids and switched out the boxes they came in for a cuter box. Good product for the price.
"Really, a sweet card for kids to send out or receive.  But as an adult, I found them just as cute.  They are very well done and quite colorful.  The inside message continues the 'magic' of the card."
One of the pins wasn‚Äôt even full length of the bracelet and the thing fell apart and onto the ground which dented the stainless and then chipped the sapphire lens. Total waste of money. And of course no recourse because it‚Äôs from a third party vendor.
I am returning these and getting the next size down as they do run large. I am unfortunately a 2X right now and I will need a 1x so keep this in mind if you order these. They are soft and comfortable feeling though.
First couple of uses it worked petfectly..for anti fog..now it just leaves a oily type film & now anti -f doesn't doesn't last 30 minutes if that..trully disappointed especially with having to wear the covid19 masks for ones that wears glasses all day everyday.
The Spartan had a few problems when i took him out of the box his DMR scope was popping off and the small pistol around thing pop of when i try to put it somewhere else but still good detail to the person
"As swelling decreased following ankle surgery, I wanted a sheer hose to wear with dressier shoes. These are serious compression hose, but they don't look like it when one wears them. As important, they are standing up well to frequent washing.  Expensive but no regrets."
I really like the design and use of these props on my Tinyhawk (always safe to add a drop of glue after the first few crashes though) great seller and great transaction! Photos are before adding these awesome four blade props.
"i love the blak ring capsules. i bought size 38 and 40 and i seem to get the inbetween to fit into either or haha. theres a few videos on youtube about them. i saw one by ""bullion stax"" and they looked way better than the normal ones."
"I bought it for my girlfriend and she is so happy. It's handmade completely and quality is equal with its price. I'm very happy to got it, It looks like a real flower. What's a lovely beautiful handmade flower brooch!"
They do a great job of cleaning my glasses. They're also a good value. My only complaint is the temporary ammonia smell that passes quickly. Other cleaners I have used in the past are usually isopropyl alcohol based and don't have a chemical odor to them like this cleaner does.
"Ridiculously hard to scratch off the top layer, left my kids frustrated and ‚Äúover it‚Äù.  Would not recommend. Threw away after only being able to scratch off half of Hawaii. Didn‚Äôt get to any other ‚Äúbigger‚Äù states. Forget about Texas."
Got this apron with my amazon rewards points for my 6 year old Granddaughter who is interested and wants to cook and bake and wash the dishes. It is Machine washable and holding up fine. Came with a little chef hat.
I bought this for my water loving green cheeck conure. The suction cups are strong and sticks in the shower great. I have no doubts about it falling. Sturdy and great quality. I hope to eventually use it in the car also. I would buy this product again!
Bought this to hold credit cards and cash while in disney so i wouldnt have to carry a wallet or purse.  I think this will do that nicely.  I may replace the strap with something thinner but other than that i am very satisfied with the product
"We bought this to replace the original cartridge that came with our printer.  There was no problem to install it, and it worked well.  Will buy again.Our printer is the Brother HL2230.[[ASIN:B004H1PB9I Brother HL2230 Monochrome Laser Printer (HL2230)]]"
I absolutely love this cushion! It has helped with my posture and back pain. I have lower back pain due to an injury and it has really helped with that. I give it a five star. You will not regret buying this cushion.
This is by far the best ems vest available. I first decided to get one after working with my Captain who owned one. I would highly recommend it if you are looking for a personal vest with the utmost versatility.
"If you have large cats (20 pounds), a small scoop doesn't do the trick and plastic ones break. The only thing wrong with this one was the handle needed to be curved upward more to be ergonomic. I used a pipe bender and mine is perfect now."
"Excellent quality. Received printed card within days.  Should request customized information BEFORE order is placed.  Had to contact the seller to provide custom text.  BUT, they responded and printed card within minutes of placing order.  Got the card within a couple days."
We love this Anna doll. She is soft enough to sleep with. She is about 14 inches tall. She is light weight and easily carried everywhere by my 4 year old daughter.  We have no complaints about the quality of ours. Love her!
"According to the manual, initial charge will take 0.5/30 minutes. It took 1.75hrs. Then the charge should allow the unit to run 28 hours...it ran for 32 hours. I'm pleased with the product. I can smell the fresh sweet air it emits."
"I loved the look and how the list was set up, but the adhesive used for the magnets was not strong enough. The list kept falling off of my fridge and on to the floor. It eventually fell in some water so I just threw it away."
Harnesses me more for dogs and a cat the top part that goes around the neck was extra huge for my cat also the adjuster part had to be burned because of slips right off of the string had to burn the string part to keep it on there
When we first received it I put it in the wash &#34;cold&#34; and when it came out the batman emblem was all cracked as if it was worn and washed a dozen times. Love the logo... but the quality is crappie.
It comes with 2 and I got one of the tens I wanted so I find this as a win. They are kinda small so I suggest you take measurements of the place you want them since they might not fill up space.
Have had a Losi MRC Pro for a long time that unfortunately was stuck in its box since I had no motor. Finally got around to actually buying this one so I could finally get the thing up and running!
Arrived quickly and was perfect for my event. My favorite thing about this product was that it comes with pre made paper rounds that perfectly fit the award. I thought I would have to cut my own and small things like that are a huge help!
"This scrubber is EXACTLY like the expensive ‚ÄúManscapped‚Äù scrubber. Don‚Äôt waste your money on that one and buy this one instead. This one does the job perfectly. Easy to hold on to and scrubs just right now. So get it, FULL SEND."
"I wasn't expecting super high quality, but was still a bit disappointed when the decal on one of the shirts peeled off almost immediately. However, my 4 year old likes the clothes a lot and they fit her Melissa & Doug baby doll and random other small doll perfectly."
"I trust the scientific background for the value of CoQ10 for my health, not any quickly noticeable benefits. The heart muscle needs this nutrient to keep functioning well. And my heart has been doing quite well. The price and quality of this brand is topnotch and competitive."
"So much posters for the price! It‚Äôs worth it, I personally kept the plastic on them but you can also take it off. My daughter is only 2 but she‚Äôs very smart and already know her alphabet, colors, shapes etc ‚ô•Ô∏è"
I was looking for a necklace that I could take on vacation instead of bringing one with real diamonds; I was not disappointed. Its delicate but sturdy and lays very nicely on my neck - I love the layered look and would definitely recommend it!
"I really love these pants,  They fit me so good and the length is perfect I ordered petite.They wash really good and hold their shape,Won't buy anything else except these pants.  I also bought the capris which were also really good."
This product does not have the quality I had wanted. I would expect a little bit more Firmness on the pad in order for the ‚Äùneedles‚Äù to fully work. Instead it's to squishy and doesn't really do what its supposed to do
"I like the idea of the product I bought it for my son for self motivation. The quality and size, are great + the fill in content is pretty well thought, definitely recommended I will buy again for my young daughter when she is older."
I have a bigger dog so these bowls come in handy. Easy to take anywhere. Just make sure you dry them well when done so they don‚Äôt get moldy. I just had to replace my last set. My fault. Highly recommend. Love the bigger size.
This dress is adorable but no way would it fit a 5 year old.  This thing was huge.  WE brought it to the beach for family pictures with my grand daughter.  We had to bunch up and tie the back up to even fit for pictures.
I have a husky so my dog loves to tear everything apart when it comes to her toys. This little elephant is very durable and stays in tack even during playing tug of war. My husky loves it and takes it everywhere she goes.
"So far, I do not see a change in my dog, but it's only been 4 days since he's been taking it.  The plus side is he loves the product.  I have no problems giving it to him."
My Tonkanese cats are prone to gum disease.  This product applied to their teeth and upper gums has made a huge difference.  Their gums arebetter after 6 months than they were right after they had their teeth cleaned last time at $200+ each.
I really liked these. I wore the white one for about a week off and on. Slept with it on. Ot started to look a little worn but that's to be expected. The excess chain must've got caught on something at my work and ripped off. But it still fine!
Love this costume. We purchased this for my 5 yr old grand son after he met some forest rangers. He was so excited! He really loves to wear the glasses when he is not a ranger but just wants to be cool. Great quality!
"I was thinking it was more of a larger coloring book style kit I guess. It's actually pretty neat, like coloring paper dolls with a sticker collection, but I'd have liked more photos to see what I was actually buying."
"These booties are sooo cute, I am a Fresno State alumni and when I saw these I had to have them. My baby is due in October so I have not had a chance to use them yet, but I am really excited about them!"
"I had to knot the bungee to shorten it. I still need to use a metal barrier at the top of my seats, but this helps. I got this one, because it allows the vent to blow the air or heat to the back of the car."
"Wow, each one of these roller essential oils smells amazing. I really, really love the Big Love one. One of my favorite scents. It is a wonderful blend of different scents that takes grapefruit and turns it into something lovely."
"These are so much less expensive than other brands and the work perfectly.  They easily feed through my printer with no curling, and adhere quite well to the bubble mailers that I frequently use.  They are a great product at a great price!"
"I'm so glad I found these! They are really durable and have lasted much longer than any other emery boards I've bought. Getting 5 works out great for me to have one for my bathroom, night stand, work, the car, and travel bag."
small in size and The Bears logo was stained on back of shirt like it had set in the sun to long. I didn't return it figured my little girl could wear it to bed. since I paid so little for it.
"I'm a northern boy that moves to the deep South,  all my friends are southern born country boy and girls. They all believe in southern pride, I bought this hat to have fun with my friends to remind them that I'm from the north."
"I am a size 8 and after reading the reviews saying it runs small, I ordered a XLI should have ordered a XXLThe suit fits my torso, but the boob area is too small.  I am a 38C and the girls keep coming out from the bottom"
The shirt came in time.  With one arm having weakness it was a little hard to use buttons but with the magnetic buttons it has made dressing easier and quicker.  Thank you!  Hopefully their will be more choices.
I was able to use but syringe don't reach down lo enough into bottle. This leave a good amount of  water unusable. Medline is better but if a family caregiver I can't order so I will make do for now!
Works well with Dogtra 1900NCP. Need to tuck the excess elastic under the collar or your dog might chew on it. Tucking under the collar causes it to pull the hair. Still saves a ton of time and hence I would definitely recommend it.
"Not bad at all! I like this bralette and it's really cute. I kinda wish it were white instead of grey, but oh well. It's just a little bit itchy if I wear it all day, perhaps it'll get better over time?"
I did not pay attention to the quantity or I misread how many this was. I got 6 individual soups for $27.95. On Cheey you can get a package of 8 for $9.00 or less. Rip off!!!Do not buy. Check other options.
"The shirt hung on me like a dress and if you have any back fat at all, this will show it for sure (because of the material). I am giving this to someone else who likes it, though. All is not lost."
"These are really cool glasses for some probably pretty temporary fun! They make weird and awkward stocking stuffers as you can see in the picture lol! They do look really cool lit up and aren't uncomfortable to wear, which was surprising! A fun novelty gift item!"
"This dress is sheer!! Completely see through. You cannot wear as a dress, possibly a bathing suit coverup but not even worth the money for that option. Where a tag typically is, there's thread and runs in material. Very disappointed and being returned. Don't waste your money."
I have bought 3 of these. My dog loved them. The venison is eaten in about 5 minutes but he works on the bone for days. Lately they have gone up in price so I will be waiting to see if they come back down.
Also does a great job covering my dogs tummy and entire torso.If I could only get him to where boots!! We‚Äôve had temps well below zero and his little paws don‚Äôt last long.  But most days he is happy with his cold weather vest. Material and workmanship are excellent.
"i'VE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR OVER 8 MONTHS NOW, BEFORE i STARTED, i HAD TO QUIT WORK EARLY, MY KNEES HURT SO BAD, i HAVE A LAWN SERVICE & THERE'S A LOT OF WALKING DURING THE DAY. SENSE i STARTED THIS PRODUCT , i CAN GO JUST ABOUT ALL DAY,"
"My almost two year old daughter loves this baby. She takes her baby everywhere, takes naps with her, everything. It is a bit expensive listed here (at time of this review it is listed at almost $30), i bought ours at Walmart for less that $13. Still a recommended toy."
Had fun putting this together.  It is challenging but not hair-pulling difficult.  The quality is good as well - no issue with the pieces.  I love the picture too.  Took about 3 days working on it for about 3 hrs/day on average.
Love this bone meal for my dogs.  I feed a natural diet and like to make sure my ratios for food are correct and this covers the 10% bone part.  My dogs like it and it seems to work very well.
The only thing I don't like is the cut outs it has the two different circles and I thought it just had the small one. I had professional pictures printed out at print store for custom dvd labels for wedding turned out really good hope they stay one
"Leak Leak Leak -- the best thing about them the mice like to hide under the stand and where the bottle is suppose to go. i took the water out, tired of cleaning up the mess but i left the stand, they love it.  so the stand gets 5*****"
"My husband and I have heat rashes for over 20 years. We find this powder and applied it for about 3 times, rashes almost all gone. And the itchiness calmed right away when we put it on. You won‚Äôt be disappointed with this product."
"I wear dresses like this at home all the time. I put on leggings and a necklace, then I am all dressed up. I get many compliments on this dress. It feels great, wash it, hang it to dry, no need of ironing. It is great for travel also."
"While these are cute and a multi pack, they run small to begin with. The FIRST time they were laundered, they fell apart (pads fell out and fell apart) and they shrunk. Not worth the money of the multi pack!! Very disappointed in quality!!!!"
"Our grandson (5yrs old) loves this toy! He can‚Äôt wait to get this out in the dirt this coming summer to start digging!! He‚Äôs already having it pick up small things in the house, it‚Äôs quite strong and durable. Great purchase"
"These electrodes are way overpriced, and manufacturer recommends replacing every 2 weeks.  While the sticky pads still worked, somewhat, after 2 weeks, they were dirtier and softer than I would have expected, particularly since I wasn't wearing them at night.  NeuroMetrix needs to keep working to improve."
Very cute and useful but the fit is a bit loose around my tubing on my stethoscope so it slides up and down too much. The one I had previously from another vendor fit perfect. Otherwise it works good in case I forget my watch one day.
I bought these to make paper flowers.  Nice tool to have if you want to make the center of the flower.  easily cut the thin paper but had to put on the blades to get the clean deep cut.  Not the best but will do it's job.
"I have one adult cat that is very overweight. I thought I would try this in an attempt to make him lose some weight, but he turned his nose up at it. Nothing against the brand, but my cat is just picky."
Absolutely in Love! I'm usually a large and ordered a size up just in case. I probably could of gotten a way with a large but I like the comfy feel. So happy with it and went ordered another one in a different color Lol.
I loved these stickers.  We used them for my grand daughter‚Äôs goodie bag at her birthday party. She put the thank you sticker on the outside of the bag and the unicorn sticker inside the bag for her friends.
"I love these underpants! They are supportive and comfortable. They do not ride up. They look cute. Also, they were well priced. I bought one pack to try them, but will be buying a second pack.Highly recommend for fit, comfort, and price."
"My daughter likes this but the pieces are much larger than I expected, so if a child makes them all you will need a large space to store or display them in.  Cubes are probably about 3&#34; each side.  Easy to put together."
"This product is a great concept but the company added unnecessary toxic dyes i.e. FD&C Red $40, FD &C Blue #1 and FD&C Yellow #5.  It doesn't make sense to add these suspect dyes to a product that is supposed to support brain health."
Love it! Only wish it came with a chain. No problem have one I can use. It comes with small cord that is adjustable. Can be worn as long necklace or Crocker. It's larger then it appears in photo which I like a lot! Great summer piece.
"I love the dress. Just what I expected. I followed the recommendation posted on some of the reviews about ordering it one size larger. And those reviewers are correct. The size runs pretty small. But other than that, beautiful dress!"
"Super easy to use, fit over the tube no problem. Can stand up or lay down.Unfortunately, I thought this would be a fully enclosed item and it is not. Makes it a little harder to clean and not quite as pretty."
"It‚Äôs REALLY good.  Food-grade quality silicone, stays in place, and prevents spillage.  My dog‚Äôs huge pit bull snout can still fit in and drink.  I love it!  Everyone needs one.  No spillage in my car on rides."
Best magnet aquarium cleaner I've used. Super strong so BE CAREFUL. I had to ask my husband to pull the two sides apart when I first opened the package but it does a great job once you've got it on the aquarium glass.
This is a nice watch for boys or girls. It tells time well and seems to hold it charge. The games are cute. The 9 yr old seems to enjoy them and has used the watch consistently since receiving it.
I love how cute this is compared to the standard tan and bland cat scratching post. I also like that it has different textures to it. It was so easy to assemble I didn‚Äôt even need directions! Just a wonderful product
"Very pretty! It's easy to get on and off and to adjust. My only complaint is that I can't make the ring small enough to fit my tiny fingers, but it's one of the few bracelets that actually fits my wrist!"
"The playing cards are super cool. I am giving them as a gift, so I havent played or opened the box, but it looks awesome! I am also very happy with the shipping! I received it very early and very quick!"
I actually love this purse. I‚Äôm a mom of two and needed something small to carry my phone and wallet along with a few other small items and it‚Äôs great! So comfortable to wear when I‚Äôm running around with my hands full.
These are super great!  The eggs themselves not only work as storage for the dinos but it‚Äôs the dropping station to get them spinning.  They are taller than they looked online and very well made.  Definitely happy with this purchase!
I love The concept of these tights. They look great on all the models. I am a size 12 and I purchased the plus size having read the reviews. It was either the total wrong size or not meant for anybody over the size 8
"Poor quality, not what I expected or what was pictured. It appears the unicorn is glittery gold, but it looks like it was a photo copied print. Very disappointed, but too late to return since my daughter‚Äôs birthday is this weekend."
I bought these for my daughter's birthday party and she LOVED them! They are super cute and made of more durable materials - not chincy. There are so many pieces - worth the money! I saved them to use again in the future!
Why didn't I buy these years ago? These have made the grooming of my two dogs soooo much easier. They are nice and sharp but the points are blunt so I don't have to worry about poling them when cutting their face.
"These are overpriced, but it makes it easy to fold the rose.  I have used them before and it seems the quality of the napkin has gone down. Oh, for best results, separate the whit portion. When you do this, be careful. The colored part tears easily."
"I ordered thinking it would fit my 65 lb dog as other jackets he always had taken a medium.RUNS VERY SMALL, I think it would fit 30-40 lb dog. They should of stated it was for small breed.Wil give it as a gift when I find a dog small enough."
"This toy performs cool stunts and runs on different terrains. Currently, you have to unscrew and remove the battery cover each time you charge the toy. I would be fully satisfied with this toy if the toy motorcycle can be charged hassle free w/o the need to remove battery cover."
I had to cut a notch in the back of each shoe because the hole you put your feet in in too small to slip over my kids heels. Also the port to plug them in can rub on the kids ankles if it‚Äôs not pushed down really well
"Perfect transaction! I paid, they shipped ahead of schedule. I installed it and it seems to work perfectly in a garage door back up power application. Thanks for the great service. I will use you again on my next need."
"i PURCHASED THIS BRACELET FOR MY BIRTHDAY AS A GIFT TO MYSELF, AND I LOVE IT ITS VERY GIRLY AND I LOVE THAT IT IS PINK. IF YOU ARE A RUFF PERSON DONT BUY THIS ALTHOUGH IT IS STURDY YOU WOULDNT WANT TO MANGLE THE HEART."
These thick leggings are NOT see through in the proper size. They are very stretchy and comfortable. They aren‚Äôt as thick as some others but they are sufficient to keep modesty. They include pockets so that is a plus. The color is beautiful.
They are labeled as Men‚Äôs Crew socks.... not even close... very thin and very small and short. Would never fit my husband. I kept them for myself or guest when they need a pair of socks that I don‚Äôt mind them keeping... very misleading description
"I have a Doberman and a min Australian shepherd.  This collar was necessary to protect the little ones neck from rough play.  It is thick, sturdy and so far has survived better than any  regular fiber collar.  It also looks stylish andI would buy it again."
"I need pigeon bands but didn‚Äôt have a bunch of money and so I took a chance on the cheapest bands I could find, sure they are from china but work awesome and  you can take them off pretty easy but a pigeon can not get them off."
"product worked for a little while, but like others have said, the best does not work. The adapter broke and I can't find a replacement, so now I have a paperweight. Spend a little more and get something that will last."
My wife and I bought this product previously while we were in Ottawa for a family visitThis item is amazing. We love it. Used regularly it is very soothing.Could not find it in the United States. Thank you Amazon for making it accesible.
"I sent this as a gift hoping for a fun, cute bracelet she could wear. She's a huge Harry Potter fan! However, when she opened the package, it immediately broke. I am disappointed and so is she. And I'm embarrassed that it was so cheaply made. It will be returned."
I was a little skeptical - and had a REALLY hard time finding anything close to these for my 20 mos old son.  I LOVE them - they are perfect for our cold weather activities and I would by them again.
Very good quality on the banner material.. will definitely last year after year.  Held up in the wind for the most part.  Had to reinforce the hanging ribbon but that's no fault of the product... it was extremely windy.
There is nothing to complain about. I own a couple of Lamy fountain pens as well and they are amazing for the price. I own fountain pens given a gifts that cost over 10 times more. While they are beautiful they really don't write any better.
"I regretted wasting my money on this trash . First of, the lid cover and the rest could not open and not what I expected. It breaks easily efficiency is bad . I would not recommend anyone to waste their money on this trash toy ."
"This scanner does exactly what I need it to do. I can use it cordless or connected with the USB. When it's wonky cordless, you can just reset it by scanning the factory settings barcode in the little booklet. Very user friendly!"
I like length but the material is too transparent. The other issue is that that can be causing this issue is material is really thin and it shows the material of what bra your wearing. Ok to wear under a jacket or something.
"Easy to fill for adults, smaller hands will need help filling. Playing with the watergun is perfect for my 3 year old.  Pointing the gun down does cause the water to leak out though. Good product for the Price."
I sprayed the product on pea gravel around my fire pit and it did not glue the rocks solid. I guess that is my own fault because it just says gravel dust......and not the rocks its self. I guess I will be buying the real stuff to redo it again.......
"This is the cutest, softest and most cuddly teddy bear for a little one.  It is made with love in the USA. Definitely a quality toy and wish every child could have one. Our 1 year old loves to cuddle with it at night. Brings sweet dreams."
"Creative and clutch. Good for kids up to adults and it's all self contained. The crayon/colored pencil is an awesome little throwback in itself. The scrolls are beyond creative and really interesting. 10 out of 10, great job and great customer service to boot."
"They are so pretty, I love them. I have a lot of butterfly jewelry, but this has to rate among the top of my collection.  Orange is unusual, and hard to find, but this hits the nail on the head."
Didn't know it was a 2014 but that's my bad for not reason carefully. The book however is cheaply made and writing with inky pens bleeds to the back of the page. I use it just to jot down notes since I do not need a 2014 planner.
"We've been using harnesses for years for my four legged children but they always seemed like they required too many steps to put them on, but the Gooby harness truly is simple and works wonderfully. Also we followed the fitting instructions and it fit perfectly! Love this harness!"
Do not buy this toy.  It does not work. Anybody profiting from the sale of this toy should be ashamed of themself.  What a disappointment to children!  This item doesn't even deserve one star!  But that's the lowest rating it can get!
"We purchased the pink block set when my daughter was two. Now that she's three, we wanted to expand. This trio building set works great. Completely compatible with the other sets. No problems of the blocks clicking or anything. Great purchase."
"these balloons went perfect with the theme for my daughters 1/2 birthday photoshoot. unfortunately, i did not know how to blow up the 2 big rose gold block balloons. it came with a straw, but after messing with it, it broke."
"My only complaint is the weight.  I believe the intention is that you are able to throw this around (at your TV) without much fear of damage, but this is heavy enough that my husband and I aren't comfortable throwing them at the TV."
"I originally gave these dishes a 5 star review, after several weeks of use, I have now changed that to a 3 star review. Very cute, but, too small for 2 cats, and once refilling the water dish, its almost impossible to carry without spilling!"
"Purchased this in Navy for a wedding.  Love it!  I am 5‚Äô 2‚Äù, ordered a small which was a bit below my knees.  I shortened to just above my knees.  Dress does not wrinkle, is lined and a great buy."
Was looking for a nice knit beanie with flashlight. Added bonus was the blur tooth audio player built into the hat. Gave it to my husband for Christmas. Don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs worn it yet but I expect rave reviews when he does.
I tried so many products to get the scratches off of my dining table they were caused by my cats when they were kittens. A couple that were a little deep. This product was a miracle immediate effects. So thankful
"This is a good idea that needs work. The collar needs to be cut to adjust size, do NOT cut the wire. After adjusting for small size it did not form a smooth circle, and the tubing made it bulky."
"I got this light for my 36 inch tank. It could be a little brighter and I still am trying to figure out some settings for overnight. Its completely dark 3am to 6am, but I also want darkness from 12am to 3am."
"I love the way this scented my shower, and my whole bathroom for 2 days after my shower.  I'd hoped to use the ""bomb"" for another shower, but the scent was gone.  Leaves behind a cake that has no more scent and so must be disposed of."
"The earrings are pretty but the back of the earrings do not click on the back of the earring, the back flips on to the ear and hurts my daughter. They just don‚Äôt  Align with the earring area hook."
"One of my dogs, the one that needs it the most had an allergic reaction, and I had to stop using it. The other two haven't had a reaction, but it hasn't stopped the fleas either. I wouldn't order again"
"I am thankful for this product. The magic this packaged content creates is AWESOME. I intentionally place 2 bags in the boys' workout room.....AMAZING. I just purchased one packet to try it.. I will be ordering a few more. Nice package, quick and fast delivery."
"Installed  in my Photosmart D110 series Like a brand new factory ink cartridge. This HP Printer has never been updated,I don‚Äôt know if that matters. Printer recognized the cartridge and I followed the on screen instructions for install and alignment.DONE!"
"Beautiful floral smell, not really honeysuckle, but wonderful regardless. Doesn‚Äôt turn the water a neon color (a massive plus to me).Fizzes for about 2 minutes, releasing so much more fragrance into the room than plain salts or essential oils.I will be keeping these around for special occasions and guests."
"It's nice, but the soft cups are just placed in a holding area, one fell out in the wash.  Easy enough to put back, but it would be nicer if they were sewn in.  Bought for my daughter for camp."
"Nice product, my 2 grandson's have been working on this for 2 evening. If it can keep them busy for that long it is a good product. They like that hood opens and parts move. We are happy with the product."
The extra long bandaid was hard to find. My husband does a lot of work with his hands and these bandaids stay on and the fit was perfect.. Loved the large size box because we don't have to worry about running out.  We highly recommend!!
The picture shown looks just like it. It‚Äôs a soft stuffed fish. The only bad thing is that the nose bends to much and doesn‚Äôt stay straight. It doesn‚Äôt matter at all to my 7 yr old grandson. He loves it.
"It's a cute concept but for some reason some of the pieces (i.e the feet) don't stay in well.  I purchased through a warehouse deal so I didn't pay the list price,  but my toddler likes it so I am satisfied."
Its so cute and looks just like the picture but it is not great quality the handle is not smooth and it rubs the Metal and the clasp that holds the lid is not very good and the lid is hard to close!
Nice tattoo set.  I was able to easily cut the sheets grouping three or four tattoos together to place in the take home party bags from my son's party.  There was a nice selection so no one was stuck with really small ones.
"We've been using it for a little over 2 weeks, and as long as it stays consistent, I'll be buying more.  I love that the print is so crisp and clear.  No lines, or smears. Great product and the price is nice."
"I thought it will be more longer then it is .but plus facts are it is sturdy ,works well for kids hands.great quality and nice color,just like on a pic.my son love them,way better then those you will find in a stores."
"great remote ""car"" for kids.  Won't break apart when they hit something and then thing plays music and spins in place, with lights - they love it!  Music can be turned off - as long as your 3 yo doesn't learn how to turn it back on!"
"The tablets are harder, thinner, taste TERRIBLE,  and leave a nasty bit of undissolved trash in your mouth! They are horrible. I've used this product for many years and the changes that have been made are so bad! I will not take another dose from this bottle!"
"It can be tricky getting the snake back in the can, but it is well worth the laughs. My only complaint is the can feels and sounds empty. On the positive, that usually means someone will open it before throwing it away."
These earrings are so cheaply made the post will break off if I try to adjust it.  The post is so long I can't keep it from poking my head and they don't hang nicely like shown in the picture.  Never buy again from this company.
Best class gift ever. The kids Loved these wands. Lots of compliments and the teacher used them at her grandsons's party bc they were such a hit in her class. Used in winter as they have &#34; snow&#34; in them. Priced out snow globes but they were much more money
This was exactly what I needed and it is pretty. The thing I didn‚Äôt like is it has two cuts or gashes running horizontally for the width of the front cover. I‚Äôm not sure this will hold up through Dec 2020 because of this.
"Costume looks cool and the martial is cool. I got a medium, but I should've sized up because it was a little short on the arms and legs. My daughter said it was comfortable. It was breathable and would be good for layering."
"I like the way this laundry detergent cleans, and I feel good using it because it's not as harsh for our environment. It smells great too! I used their other products and have only good to say about this company"
"The flap that goes over left shoulder was way to short and stuck straight out. It didn't look like the way the picture shows on Amazon, going down to the elbow. We couldn't even pull it down to the elbow."
"I was happy to have the opportunity to only purchase a can or two of flavors my cats were unfamiliar with. The toy is ridiculous and imho not worth any money, neither of my cats even took a second look at it."
The steps that come to fit under it and hold it on the console don't stay on .no matter how tight I make them.Otherwise a great seat.  My dog loves it but since it doesn't stay on the console he falls down in back a lot
"The initial ESC had issues, however HobbyFans responded quickly to my email asking for help. I ended up needing a new ESC (the motor is fine), which they shipped out as soon as possible.I'll be checking out their other products, as their customer service was very impressive."
"These are pretty decent nail files. They hold their shape while filing natural nails. The grit is rough on natural nails if too much pressure is applied, but otherwise, the finer side works well for that purpose. These work great for shaping full-coverage acrylic tips."
"Just got it in the mail and I love it! Fit great, but had a weird string spot going on at the waist that was an easy fix, thankfully I'm a seamstress! Otherwise it was great! Will order again in another color in the future."
"If you like neat and functional items for your office, you can't beat these document trays. They are simple black mesh trays that stack easily and are very functional. I prefer very simplistic office accessories and these fit the bill perfectly, and the price was great."
"I needed a large bowl that my English Bulldog puppy could grow into. This is perfect. It's large, non-skid, easy to wash and indestructible. The color is nice, too. I'm very happy with this purchase and so is my pup."
"Not hemmed at the ends and white color on the inside of gaiter. Rather be hemmed and rather same color inside and out, so you could wear either side on the outside. May fray or roll up ends after washing. Will update after usage and washing. Won't purchase again."
This was supposed to be a gift for my grandson to add to the collection of Tonkas passed down from his dad. It won't last that long. I would have returned it but I need it for Christmas. $35 ripoff.
"My son LOVES these, he takes them everywhere we go. I told him the grain harvester was a beach cleaner because he‚Äôs obsessed with the song by twenty trucks, and he‚Äôs always using it to ‚Äúclean‚Äù our carpet. A definite winner!"
"Pouch is made out a pliable synthetic leather with a softer inside surface. Dimensions are large enough to easily accommodate longer and taller mailing envelopes as well as bill money. Zipper slides smoothly, the full length of the pouch. A great value!"
One of the pegs in my order had a crack. The seller quickly responded to my message and sent me an entire replacement set! It even included a hand written note. The pieces are high quality and the customer service is top notch.
"Love this paper, will be ordering more soon. Great texture, wonderful blacks and white tones- almost makes your photos look like a painting. A must have for anyone who is serious about film and printing their own on a quality looking paper."
"Figure is not the issue - looks perfect. It's the shipping standards that are awful. Like others have reported, it was shoved into a box that was too small, resulting in a ruined card. If Amazon offered a ""special handling service"" to address this problem -- I'd do it."
"After watching Godzilla Vs. Kong, I knew I had to get the Kong Funko with the battle-axe. This is one of my favorite Pops, it has great detail and I love the accent colors on the axe and on Kong's eyes. I'm glad I have this in my collection!"
This is one of the best ideas for laundry since the automatic dryer. So much easier to fold everything when the socks are already in pairs. They do occasionally fall of in bigger loads but generally make laundry more efficient.
"5 yr old loves her bluey house, plays with is almost every day. Bottom piece came unattached once but she was able to easily clip back in by herself. Fits all her bluey characters that she got from another set."
"they're good pants. very stylish and comfy. however, they do sinch at the ankle and if you are a taller individual you may want to size up. otherwise the ankles ride up and it looks akin to pirates wearing pantaloons in the 15th century."
"The description was very accurate! The engraving plaque was perfect and no misalignments or roughness! I got it for my little ones birthday theme and can‚Äôt wait to use it, as well as, have it as a keepsake! Arrived way before the expected arrival date which was an unexpected plus!"
"They are a bit short for my liking but other than that I like the nail files. They do an excellent job of filing are easy to carry around. As for durability, we will see. I haven't had them for long enough to know about that element."
My cats love this comb. We had another brand that the cats did not like so we were looking for something new and I found this one and they love it. I like how easy it is to get the hair out.
"I bought these as a Christmas present and they kids love them. The use them on car rides to doodle. ask questions, and play games like hangman, tick tac toe, and 20 questions. They are durable, easy to use, and a great gift for little kids."
Do not buy. Waste of money I couldn‚Äôt get a curl and it got super hot.Very cheap - do not compare to dyson airwrap.It is a blow dryer on a stick does not suck your hair around it it blows it.Would not recommend
"Great game but complicated to figure out - not for little kids. We went on YouTube and found an instructional video. Once you figure it out, it is fun though! And the pieces are adorable - but we are sheep lovers!"
"I clean houses for a living and this stuff works fantastic! I use it on everything from grease to bathroom soap scum, put some in mop water it works great for everything! Smells Fresh and clean also, not to strong at all!!"
Used it to re-wrap a cat scratching post. The color was a perfect match and the size of the rope was good too. Had a few feet left over after wrapping this post. The post that I wrapped was 13‚Äù high and about 3‚Äù wide.
"Have no fill yourself, no big deal but should not say prefilled. Also was missing 5 pops. Had all 24 eggs but was missing 3 pops in 1 pack and 2 pops in another. And it's not letting me contact them!"
Does a great job of cleaning ears. I squirt some on a cotton ball and wipe out the ear. My dog does not like the solution put directly into his ear. If used after every bath it prevents my dog from getting eat infections.
"I like the colors and pattern of a faded and rustic old glory. The elastic band around the top holds well. I ordered the size that was best for me, but dang they squeeze my arms so much so that‚Äôs it‚Äôs really uncomfortable. I suggest sizing up."
I got this for my boyfriend cause he loves Miku and Figmas in general. This is not a Figma since it's from Bandai but that doesn't stop it from being just as amazing! My boyfriend loves it! Really awesome buy and it came in the mail SUPER fast! :D
Easy to set up.  Were able to paste an 8.5 x 11 flyer to the header. Boxes are a good size and hold quite a few surveys. We put these up at locations all over town and they hold up very well.  Will reuse them.
"I prefer four sided organizational folders whenever possible. While six and eight sided folders may be great for final organizational files, four sided files are easier to independently organize and group information, photos, emails, documents, etc. I guess it comes down to a personal choice!"
I love these pouches! I am a teacher and my students will be using them to hold their books for choice reading. The pouches will easily be able to hold three books as well as their journal. They seem very durable.
I‚Äôm always kind of worried about the physical condition I will receive my cards but in this opportunity I got a great product in such a great condition which make me really happy. Also It was delivered fast.Thank you so much.
bought several sets for my office so my coworkers would quit stealing mine. good pliabilitly. make sure you know what you're doing and have received proper training if you are using them on a client vs yourself. there is potential to do harm.
I thought the heat will make for a longer lasting curl but no! It did not curl at all. Back to manual metal curlers for me. It‚Äôs also very cumbersome to fit your lashes into the curler due to how it‚Äôs shaped. Returned!
"Cute, but they were very difficult to get on my daughter. I think if the velcro went all the way to the bottom of the shoe it would be easier. They did help to keep her feet warm this last winter though, and are very cute."
Although this is a small item which will fit nicely in a purse of pocket I needed it for home use and it is way to small. Only holds four large capsules in each slot which is not adequate for my purposes. Will return.
Perfect for winter hiking! Bought this because my pack runs against my lower back and exposes my skin and I can‚Äôt have that in winter (plus it‚Äôs annoying). I LOVE this. It‚Äôs so comfy and fits perfect and so warm!
"My cockatiel doesn‚Äôt eat a ton of the herbs, but he seems to have a better appetite for his pellets when I mix a pinch in with his daily food. He does like to play with the more stick-like bits."
"I have used precision pet crates form many years. What came was not a precision crate, but a care crate. There is nothing that came that says this is a precision pet crate.The size says it is 23‚Äù wide. It is only 22‚Äù wide."
I was very happy that the funko pop was wrapped in bubble wrap and was packed in a way that protected the box. I also noticed there was a hard plastic cover around the box. This is my favorite funk pop that I‚Äôve purchased.
We got double ha ‚Äòs instead of the letters bir for birthday !  How is it even worth it without the required letters? Was super disappointed how are supposed to do happy hathday? ! I have a picture as well but don‚Äôt find an option to add pics!
I used these on a project that my son had. They didn't run or leave marks on your hand and they dried within minutes of being put on the poster board. I like that there was a variety of color also.
This was perfect for the dinner table deco. They help bring out the theme. I wish there were more in the pack for the price that you pay for them or at least lower the price. Over all good items.
The dress was way way way too small (ordered 9-12 months) for my  8 month old baby. I compared it to her 3-6m clothes and it was the same size. Very cute though and soft material! Just too small.
Needed tall 20 to 30 gallon aquarium in order to breed 7&#34; Discus Fish and this puppy totally fit the bill.  Well built and Amazone's packaging was impeccable (as usual) as there aren't many companies that will ship aquariums like this..
Love it! It's really cool and looks just like the picture! One small detail is that the journal I recieved is a hard cover. Idk why they have a soft cover journal in the pictures. But hard cover is always better!
"I couldn‚Äôt open the box quickly enough! This is such a neat little product. The app was really user friendly, there were no issues connecting a phone to the printer. It‚Äôs quick and fun! I plan on using it with my kiddos at school for a fun little treat"
"This is perfect for small dogs!  I had to order a large to fit my Shih- Tzu, but it is as described.  He could back out of the other harnesses I tried.  His days of escape are over!"
Works great for what I need it for. Fits in a super small spa room.  Four stars because it‚Äôs a little chintzy. It‚Äôs primarily plastic and no high or low settings.  Lastly I do miss the aromatherapy feature on my more professional unit.
These door decorations turned out nice. They were easy to hang with a few nails to hold them in place. They are pretty thick and appear to be well made and made to last at least a few Christmas seasons. I'll definitely be using them again next season.
These shades are okay but they don't last long. I've had them for a little over a month. This is the second time I've ordered and both times the screw comes out and the temple arms fall off. I really wanted to like these shades
"I raise/train pups, so the IN TRAINING message was so important for me to get across to passerbys.  This does it.  Super durable, easy to clean, easy to put on and take off, and the pups don't mind a bit.  GREAT product."
"I try to do what I can for the environment, so I love this brand. I brought them with me to serve my specialty cocktails in for 4th of July and was feeling a lot better than if they were a Solo cup."
"Hated it!  It stunk so bad.  Nothing helped.  Left it in the sun for 2 days, washed it with vinegar, then dishwashing soap, then Febreeze.  Nothing worked.  Tossed it.  All that money gone.  DO NOT BUY THIS!"
Arrived on schedule. What a difference when using this stapler compared to the normal type of stapler where you have to apply serious wrist pressure to staple something!!  You hardly push down & it staples. Thank you for making a quality product!
"Picked the fleas out like a charm. Got loose fur as well. My cat (long haired) loves to be groomed. She just purrs when i use it. Now that the fleas are gone, i use it to groom her. Safe and not pointy."
My cat loves this food bowl. But so do ants!! The way the bowl is structured the ants can climb right up in there. In the storage part I recommend putting food in plastic baggies that zip to also deter the ants it‚Äôs what I did.
"This device does offer traction for the neck. A bit of experimentation to find the best angle and position for optimum results is required.  Seems to be well made and will, hopefully, be durable. It is comfortable with good padding and soft fabric."
"RE:  InGooooD - Mini Series-World Mini Jigsaw Puzzle 1000 Pieces Romantic Town PaperWhen ordering puzzles from Amazon ... be sure NOT to order MINI Puzzle Series.  The pieces are VERY, Very, very small.  Too small for my eyes.  I am donating,"
I don‚Äôt think I bought this on my account but my mom got a new pencil sharpener so I‚Äôm guessing she got it on my account.Anyway it works really good in her office and sharpens pencils to a perfect point that doesn‚Äôt just snap.
"The paper backing is so much easier to remove than the clear plastic the others use. Works in a wide range of temperature, It‚Äôs easy to form around edges.I received mine in one day Wow w/ standard shipping, Thank you Horizon hobbies / Amazon"
Seriously well made with nice soft leather and a break guard to keep kittie safe. Very good quality and looks great on yr kittie or puppy. A little big for our 3 month old kitten but she'll grow into it!
"I was actually looking at purchasing NAC from a different distributor when I came across the reviews for PUREMEDICS. This product has the dosage and ingredients that I was looking for, without any additional fillers. It works wonderfully, and I would absolutely buy again."
There is no assembly to this gate. I love this gate. I use it to block off my kitchen from 4 dogs.  It is easy to maneuver using one hand. I wanted an extra wide gate that didn‚Äôt require mounting to my wall. This fits the requirements perfectly.
I didn‚Äôt realize that I had purchased a vintage board but it still works. We use it at the Lake on the porch. The magnet doesn‚Äôt hold a stack of cards but the weight of the cards themselves help keep themselves in place. The grandkids are fascinated!
Drone is worth about $10.  Don‚Äôt waste your time or money.  I‚Äôm trying to return it. It‚Äôs not the typical amazon return process.  You have to get a return label from seller and ship back to China for a refund.  Wish me luck
"This product does not work as stated, there is no product support.  Updating the box firmware did nothing to help program their own ESC. ESC motor box all worthless.  better off buying generic at least their programmers work."
"it would be great if the handles had a hole in them, so you could put them on a split ring of some sort. they get lost way too easily. The handle seems too STRAIGHT...a curve would seem to make it easier to manipulate."
There was assembly issue.  There was one threaded insert for &#34;upper stairs&#34; that was already stripped and not aligned.  The unit when assembled was not as sturdy as I would have expected for it being advertised for an extra large cat.
"The band is very sturdy and comfortable, although the velcro is slowly deteriorating. I remove the watch once daily and I'm noticing some velcro falling off when I remove it each time. Still staying secure on my wrist but over time I'll have to keep an eye on it."
Pretty much love all things Disney. Loved the movie. It was set in ‚ÄúThe jewel of Morro Bay‚Äù which is where I live. Great lanyard. I collect Disney pins & like to use Disney lanyards. I have some Dory pins on this lanyard.
Wears it to work everyday for his access cards and keys and flash drives etc... his complaint about previous lanyards is that the retractable mechanism gets weak after a while from the weight of all his stuff. It's been over 6 months now and it's going strong
"Bought the small for my cat and the large for my dog. Neither fit as expected, so returning the small and using the large for my cat. Will have to shop some more for one that fits my dog and looks similar to this style."
I am a medium; I‚Äôve always been a medium. So I ordered a medium. Well the sleeves end halfway up my forearms and there is no way it hits my thigh as pictured. It hits at my waist! Too bad because the knitting is nice.
"These were...much smaller than I was expecting. I like the smell but they're so small I didn't get any of the benefits of a bathbomb (smooth skin, nice smell) that I'm used to and had to use two per bath, making them run out really quickly :/"
This Pogo Hopper is much more fun than any other Pogo of its kind.  My kids take turns jumping with it and it keeps them busy for hours.  I have it for over a month and it is still one of their favorite toys.
"This puzzle was more on the difficult side then some of the others I've done and I really enjoyed the challenge. The puzzle itselfis BEAUTIFUL, and well worth the time it took to put it together. No missing pieces which is always important...........LOL"
"Comfortable enough for an executive chair, but tends to fall over backward if you lean back all the way. The pleather is soft and feels good to sit on for a moderate while. The arms become uncomfortable after a while."
Needed to showcase handcrafted art work and photos in a rustic way. I got the small and the large clips and they are perfect for my project. Pretty strong grip for the little ones too. Price was worth it for the look I was able to achieve.
"These are nice, high quality magnetic tile blocks that provide hours of fun! Very comparable to the namebrnd blocks without the huge price tag! I definitely recommend these to anyone wanting to add additional pieces to their mag a tiles collections!"
My daughter asked for a pink scented pillow pet and this seemed to fit. It‚Äôs a good size and plenty soft. The only issue we have is there really isn‚Äôt any scent to it. Kind of a big deal since it‚Äôs in the title that the thing is scented.
I use this product for electrolysis.  I put it on about an hour before I go - I don't let it every completely soak in before I put more on.  It helps SO much.  I would hate to go to my appointment without it~
"This cage is awesome. It folds down flat and has a handle so you can carry it.  It also comes with a good sized, hooked metal water bottle/accessory panel so you can adjust the height of your accessories easily."
"I cut out a section of foam packing material, poked a hole in the center, then put it into the headphone jack area of my S5 Symmetry case.  I then inserted the Pikachu dust plug and it now fits VERY snug and is perfect!"
I own two of these leashes now. They are wide but also very soft. The clip is large and holds my 100 pound dogs no problem. I would certainly buy again. I tried other brands and the fabric wasn't nearly as soft.
Flowers don‚Äôt stay attached To the tacks. In fact some were already off when it arrived.  I needed it for a project so I just used the non broken ones but since then many flowers fell off the tacks of the ones I used. Shame because they are cute.
"As a professional speaker who provides Train The Trainer Programs all over the world, including the Middle East, I found this map very helpful while traveling in Dubai.Lenny Laskowski, international professional speakerNational Best Selling Author, ""10 Days to More Confident Public Speaking""[...]"
"This product is especially useful in eliminating the use of cleansing wipes that can clog sewers and drains, when sprayed on biodegradable toilet paper.  I also like the personal size portable spray bottle that can be used to spray on public toilet seats. Great product!"
Taker is a legend and I had to have this figure what a time period this was the purple gloves era and grey gloves era were both legendary in my mind in some way or fashion but this is my favorite version of him.
"Within 45 minutes, my Jack Russell chewed loop off bill, opened bill to pull out brown grassy hair like filling and chewed a hole in it.  Not indestructible but at this price one would expect longer then 45 mins."
"The straps around the ankle, do not stay attached while wearing the shoes. I tried to return but the seller would not pay for return postage to China. Seller also wrote me an email stating, my return reason was not valid."
I bought some of this quite a while ago in a store and loved it but when I received this order I wasn't as pleased cause the fragrance didn't seem to last as long..........but I still would recommend it to others.
"To put this review simply, works great for my home office with hardwood floors and gamer chair, and it‚Äôs very easy to vacuum when dirty. I‚Äôve had it for several months and have experienced no issues. Fulfills it function marvelously, definitely recommend!"
"The fact that they clip into the back makes them my favorite earrings.  I leave earrings in for days at a time.  Recently I have been losing my lever back ones, but these have nothing to catch on clothing so they seem fallout proof."
"Fit easily into purse.  Don't have too many pages...makes it easy to find what you have written.  The cover design makes them easy to find inside purse.  Liked them so much, I gave some to a friend."
"The picture shows yellow lens for blue blocking. I didn't notice the fine print saying clear lenses. Even worse, when I tested their blue blocking ability, they have ZERO. This company is stealing your money! Do fall for it! The glasses do NOT work."
Can we just talk about this company‚Äôs softness in their shirts??? I have purchased another from them and both are soooo comfortable! Not to mention the compliments I get while wearing this. Perfect for the fall season without being itchy or overly heavy!
"If you usually wear single strength reading glasses, it takes less than a work day to get accustomed to these. Great while working outdoors or daytime driving. Not too dark for some indoor use.Comfortable and secure fit for all-day wear."
"If i could give a zero I would.I do not usually write reviews, but this product was such a rip off, I felt I needed to warn others.  We have five dogs and not one responded to this at any of the levels or distances. Save your money."
These were great for our silly string fights. Slips on and off with ease. Gave the smaller grandkids a fighting chance with these guns. Their little fingers can‚Äôt keep up with the bigger kids so these guns leveled the playing field.
"I purchased this because I've been slouched over a computer all day for a job. It works on me as a reminder to stand straight, it is not hard or rigid just a gentle feeling against my back. Great for posture correction."
"I'm not exactly a collector of candy colored clicky-clacky math rocks, this is the fourth set I own, but this set is everything you could want. Sharp edges, high gloss, no bubbles, sparkly film inclusions, and large, well-defined and well-inked numbers. I have not tested their randomness, however."
"POTENTIAL BUYER PLEASE NOTE: Dispenser does not have single hand grip bottom groove as pictured (multiple times). Makes using the product less seamless, but no less effective. Bottom of dispenser is flat (classic Scotch Tape dispenser), making its use more of a two-handed operation."
"El material parece bueno es flexible, no se deforman cu√°ndo las doblas, el arte de la caja me parecio muy bonito aunque la caja se rompe muy facil, ya que se rompio cuando la abri, me ubiera gustado que la caja fuera de un material mas durable y resistente."
"This product was easy to use, with beads I already had. I made myself a pen, and while it's pretty, the ink cartridge slips back into the pen after writing with it. I hoped this was just a fluke. But subsequent pens did the same."
"The Sytiz Seamless Workout Outfit is very comfy and cute.  I've worn it a handful of times while working out this winter because it does help keep you warmer than just a sports bra while still looking cute.  It's pretty stretchy, looks good, and is not see through."
Inflated the arch it would not stand up on its own and once the hose was hooked it continously fell over. Then the shark teeth that the water is supposed to come out of began to disconnect from the rest of the arch. Not a good product
My hubby has been wearing these for years.  We went to Costco to buy more and there were none.  I was so happy to find them on Amazon.  They are exactly the ones he loves and he‚Äôs a happy guy now!
"It rolls on really nicely, it has not irritated my skin the last few nights and it is a pleasant smell. I was expecting a stronger smell of lavender or the chamomile but the bergamot gives it a different twist. It is a relaxing smell"
I was very proud to give this item as a gift. It‚Äôs a very nice product at a great price. I should mention that this style of head collar is excellent for dogs who want to tug and pull with their leash.
I purchased these highlighters specifically to use in textbooks.  They worked beautifully.  They did not smear in a textbook and easily erased.  I tried using them with a regular FriXion pen and it did smear.  But no big deal because I was aware ahead of time.
"I WANTED TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM COMING TO SELL OR BEG FOR DONATIONS. IT HAS WORKED WELL. MY SUBDIVISION HAS A SIGN THAT SAYS NO SOLICITING, BUT PEOPLE CLAIM THEY DON'T SEE IT. THEY SEE THE ONE ON MY DOOR!"
"These rolls used to be big, now they‚Äôre no bigger than single rolls. And the package was generic, without the Northern Quilted logo, and was torn with rolls falling out inside the box. I hope Amazon remedies this, I have liked this brand in the past very much."
"Great little wagon. Sturdy, well built and easy to assemble. I use it to haul plants and gardening tools around, and to bring groceries in from the garage.I especially like that this model has metal wheels. My last wagon had plastic wheels which broke under excess weight."
"Love it now i can take my yokie to walmartFits good he could get out of it if he tried , it could be more secure. But it‚Äôs made well and i like the color i hVe the red one"
"These are the best thing I have ever found for my son who is in a wheelchair, and deals with skin break down. I wish they were made in a darker color. But this has helped reduce the issues he has had with his toes and ankles over the years."
"This is a great giftable item for anyone child 5+ yrs of age. Very durable however have to be careful with the actual Polly pocket doll herself; if pulled too hard, their legs separate from the rest of the body. Overall great purchase"
"Received today (a little earlier than expected) and mostly disappointed with this case. Better than nothing I guess, but seems like it won't last very long (cheaply made) and has a funky smell that I really hope will dissipate soon."
"flimsy and much thinner than DJI original and orange tip is not rubber like original, its just painted on and blades are out of balance, much cheaper than original and you're going to disappointed and waste your money and time, I think."
"Not the greatest ‚Äúkitchen‚Äù set but, not bad for my toddler. She likes cutting the little fruits, but she doesn‚Äôt really care about the rest of it.  It didn‚Äôt come with the cutting board, though, and the ‚Äúhot plate‚Äù didn‚Äôt work once I put batteries into it."
"I am in LOVE with this journal. It looks like a well crafted book from Medieval times! It's so pretty and so well built! It's large too, so I've got lots of room! This would be a perfect gift for someone!"
"This is a fun co-op game to play. It feels tricky to learn, since there are a lot of different parts to the game. But it is really entertaining and it's a nice change to work as a team instead of against other players"
"Great reusable straws. Nice colors. They didn't come with a straw cleaner, luckily I have some but others may not. They are pretty thick so it may not be necessary. They are nice and squishy so you don't hurt your teeth like on the metal ones."
"These seem to be durable folders.  They appealed to me because it mentioned easy to remove labels, however the label wasn‚Äôt too easy to remove when I tried to move it.  Other than that, seems to be decent folders, we‚Äôll see as the school year proceeds."
"Most of the pens are great, but often there will be one or two that do not meet up with expectations.  Mostly the glitter pens are the ones that fail to work adequately.  Overall, the pens are worth the money, however."
"I got these only because the realness of the picture. The picture is not depicted. You get cockroaches that look like all the other cockroaches on Amazon. Disappointed that a fake picture was used, and I didn't get what was advertised."
"I like this colorful teether toy for babies. It includes a pop it section, a small circle to move between 3 slots, 3 rings, and the strings to pull up and down. There are plenty of textured silicone strings to pull and chew. Is also has different shapes as well."
"I measured my dog per the instructions and it was way too big when I received the product. Pain to return because its a $5 item and was told to reorder, but if I reorder, I have to pay shipping since my order will not be $25."
"It works as well as the old one that I have, it said it was a five second tester, that is not true, it gives you dots till it gets down to a five second count down, it still take the same time as the old tester, just formatted different."
"This is a large, heavy piece with great detailing.  Unlike most of the large pendant necklaces I own the chain is not overly long (it reaches to my chest when worn).  Good quality and should last many wearings."
"I've had a number of silicone rings and this is by far the best!! It looks great and is comfortable to wear, and like all silicone rings, you don;t have to worry about loosing a finger if you get it caught on something. I highly recommend this product"
"Wire Frame bent in multiple spots, those black clips are worthless, would not recommend this to anyone due to the price and poor quality.  After it fell apart yet again, decided to chuck this thing and go a different route."
This is a great way of working out knots on those hard to reach spots on your back.  My massage therapist recommended it to me.  I need to order the trigger point manual as it doesn't come with the cane.
"This was difficult to order the correct size on.  I think I got one slightly too big but the next size down indicated it would not fit my pooch.  It was very heavy for a small dog to wear, too, so I returned it."
"great product, well designed, more moisturizing than most saline sprays. this is easy to use & the multiple nozzles that come with it allow you to choose if you want to use it more like a nasal wash or a nasal spray."
"Disappointed. Pieces were warped and sometimes difficult to put together. My daughter was helping me one evening and she noticed the same thing. It didn't lay flat, either when it was put together. Too bad as the picture was beautiful - very vintage Christmas."
"Only problem I had was with delivery - they SHOVED this thing into the parcel locker and bent the part that helps you to hang the calendar. It's still functional but annoying that the hanger is bent.Aside from that, this is such a cute calendar."
"They have these big vents for the heating system, and his office is always about 90 degrees. These do the job, though the magnetic part of it doesn't seem to have a really strong hold. But it did the job it was intended for in our case"
The arms and legs are just the clothing and look limp when you get up close but they could be easily filled to look better. No hands and no feet or shoes. But overall it‚Äôs good quality and really creepy!!!
"I love puzzle boxes. This was a really beautiful box. I loved the craftsmanship. It does take a little bit of figuring out (not very difficult), but it is exciting. There are a couple of steps before the final reveal. Excited to add this to my collection"
There are so many items inside this nail kit. The nail polish actually dries pretty fast. There are so many different ways that you can craft and create your nails. It‚Äôs so fun and give the girls lots to do while making them feel beautiful!
"Very heavy and cute design, but wished the paint was better quality.  Received with paint around the eyes chipped off.  Didn‚Äôt feel as though I should pay that amount for an already damaged item.  Returned it without issue, so 3 stars for that and the design."
"Was really excited about this dress when it came but when I opened it, it looked like dyes made discolored lines on the print part of the dress. I ordered a medium but the material seemed like it may shrink after washing."
"Well, it gave me good breath but that's about it. I eating a good diet and exercising and when I added this to the equation it did no harm and no good. Maybe it was just me or maybe this is just another fad."
"The color of my Cichlids got 20-30% more pronounced by using this product within 30 minutes, and stayed that way. The salt took GH from 80 up to 200 ppm. TDS went from 100-150 up to 250-300 ppm. pH stayed at 7.8. KH stayed at 80 ppm."
"[[VIDEOID:7bd2e02061268bae17452c95888849ac]] Very light and portable.  This would be good if you move around a lot I think, such as in an office.Scan it over a document , grab the image and then transfer to your computer.  Very simple I think.Overall it seems nice and I like the design"
"Perfect for our Yacht Club Commodore's Ball!  They are tiny and we decided not to use name tags as they did not sit straight. But, they looked fantastic on our burgee plates on top of an anchor napkin....loved these!"
"These cards do not have a gold edge, which is what ""gilded"" means. And I scanned the QR code to get the guidebook but it goes to an error page. They say ""email us"" for the book, but...to what email?"
Really helps protect the elastic in my compression hose. I handwash and dry naturally - using this wash the life of my compression hose is extended. It only requires 1/3 tsp per time - a little goes a long way - seems to last for months and months.
"This is good educational lego-like block. It comes with many instruction cards telling how to build letters, numbers and shapes. It also allows my kido to use his imagination to build anything, the block pieces can be connected/stacked in many ways. Love it."
"These are great, real jean, thick, made well. They DO NOT run small, I‚Äôm not sure why so many people have said they do, maybe they changed them after the reviews? But they run true to size or a little bigger than true."
"Have been using these for so many years, & I order my next years as soon as they are available. These are great for important notes, appointments & I can't do without them as don't want to use my phone for everything. Hope they keep making them forever!"
I like it but to me it's not REALLY a game...when you open the box you get an alphabet set of cards with adorable interlocking pieces to a picture...so you lock the letter/puzzle piece to the picture/puzzle piece...worth 4 bucks to me lol...
"Exactly what I was expecting.  This was supposed to be a gift for my son-in-law for Christmas.  But when I opened it I was so excited that I gave it to him early. He's a huge Yoda lover, so it worked out great."
"The workmanship is great. The likeness is nothing short of amazing! The customer service at each step of the process was so helpful (I'm talkin' to you, Tasha!). I'm convinced my interactions with customer service contributed greatly to the final product being so perfect. These guys are great!"
"my favorite, except price bounces all over the place.  like the one with protein peptides best!  mixes well. need only 1/2 scoop!  has only collagen 1,3,5 i think, the right combo bc you are not supposed to put all types in one mix.  no taste!"
We got this for our 8 year old daughter for Christmas and man was she thrilled. She put the whole thing together on her own. She really would love to make a new one soon. Very easy and fun project.
Love the fit of this top but be cautious if washing with lighter clothes it will dye them and stain even after the first wash. That is the only flaw with this top. Wish I would have known and I would have saved so many other tops being stained.
"Generally the product is good.  I have used before, but one of the black inks could not be recognized by the printer.  Maybe quality control had a problem.  Will continue to use this product if this order works out.  The price is great."
Bought two of these for two of my grandsons.  The cape was very thin paper.  It is very flimsy.  Not the usual Lego quality I have seen.  The cape did not last one week.  Would never buy this again.
I bought this item for a webkinz stuffed animal and the neck was really too big.  It is an OK item but I will be making my own doll clothing for the stuffed animals from now on. I think they are all very overpriced.
Perfect fit for my 1960 15 hp seaking by GALE  (monkey wards OMC in house brand)Up and running in less than 15 min.Built in filter. Easy access . Quick hose configuration w/360 deg. lock down.Rebuild parts readily available.Awesome fiind
"It's not as display shown,there's no elastic gathering at the end of the feet and shoulder to waist is really short and it sad capri,, well it's really ankle length..overall nice material and love the style ..wish it did fit me well though.."
"I was confused when I received this product. They're just flat pieces of plastic. I had assumed that they were 2 pieces that could be held together with adhesive, but there's no adhesive and no instructions on what to do with them. They're useless without instructions."
"Poor material. Not exactly wallet shaped either. It's way too hard to put cards in & take them out, they stick because of the type of plastic the whole wallet is made of. I gave this 3 stars only because i adore the little pin!"
"This is the second time I purchased Sophia Global Refurbished Ink Cartridge Replacement for HP 61XL.  I did not have any problem with the first purchase.  It works great.  I mean, I couldn't tell that it was refurbished or refilled."
It's a good product. The shock feels like when you put your tongue on a 9 volt. I bought it to keep my son's jerk cat off the counter. The evil menace learned within a day where to put her feet so she wouldn't get shocked.
"I bought this a few months ago, for my hamster's tank. Still kicking myself to buy actual clips for it, but it's been holding firm! I've been weighing it down with rocks to stop my hamster from somehow climbing out."
"Was a little afraid that the quality of material would be suspect, in that it would be light weight and not hold up.  Not the case at all.  Very nice quality and stitching is solid and will hold up."
We get in the car and Mozzy fall right to sleep in her car seat. Love the fact it has a leash inside. If I may make a suggestion when putting this together use heavy duty crazy glue where parts connect.
I purchased these tatoos to be buried at the beach as part of the treasure for a 3 yr olds pirate themed birthday party. They were enjoyed and the whole party was a hit! I was pleased to find them here as I could not locate them locally.
Was delivered so that's the most important thing but the gift card message never was!  Family member thought it came out of the blue and wasn't sure if it was real or had hidden attachments if they used it!
"These rolls are comparable to the actual Brother branded labels.  I find the adhesive is actually better.The paper used is slightly thinner, and for me seems to be easier to peel the backing off.Overall I am very happy with these labels."
Didn‚Äôt work and there‚Äôs no CS for help. Wasn‚Äôt easy to use or setup. Label would print incorrectly even when making adjustments to printer settings 4x6. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this printer to anyone. Save yourself the headache and get one that‚Äôs a little bit more money.
These were very hard to find. They are not available in any stores where we live and my son wanted them bad. These were a great find for a great price. My son and all of his friends love them and have had many of hours of fun.
"This was a gift for a child who loves ducks and didn't disappoint everyone loved this gift for laughs all night from the mimic function, says 120 preprogrammed songs but does repeat alot but well see over time the different songs.  Still recommend"
I tried several support braces before running upon this one. It was the first one that actually had support and did not cut into my arms. After wearing for 3 hours it felt good and not like it over exaggerated the posture. I‚Äôd recommend this.
"Colors are off, the mouse pad was extremely thin, and the only good part was the color of the hand and wrist pads. I wasn't impressed, the quality was just to poor for my tastes. Went with a different gaming pad in the end."
My Granddaughter loves this baby dragon. We also purchased the Love Dragon to go with this and she was thrilled with both. The product is excellent and we would not hesitate to order from this company in the future. Many thanks!
Supposedly certified organic but I was disappointed to see this product was made in China.  I don't have trust in anything supposedly &#34;organic&#34; or &#34;organic&#34; being properly vetted from China.  I will use it and then move on to a different product/brand next time.
My cats have to be on a protein diet to avoid health issues. I wasn‚Äôt certain they would like this good after reading the reviews. But all 3 gave a 5 paws up! They love it!! My only complaint is the size of the containers.
"90 dollars what a rip off. It's all bent up, none of the ornaments stay on it they're all falling off and I haven't even worn it yet I took it off and put it in the corner cuz it looks horrible.. looks like a hobo hat"
"The stone is pretty, it sparkles like mad. It's just large enough to not look completely fake. The downside is that there are deep scratch marks in a few of the prongs and the stone is loose.Update:One of the prongs has now broken, making the ring unwearable."
"We use this bsllvyk play fetch with our dog. We like it because it's easy to find in the dark and our dog, a yellow retriever, loves playing with it. It's easy to charge and the charge lasts a long time."
Dice seem smaller than I expected and black carry bag was not included.  These are not standard size dice.  Quality seems ok and they should work for my purposes.  Points taken away for lack of carry bag that should have been included.
Every time I do PVP and lose I rage quit and get mad.  Now I just squeeze master chief and I feel better.  A little expensive but my parents pay for this so who really cares. Quit hatin.  Payyyyyce out pwner.
I have four cats that need entertainment. Buying that many toys can be expensive! This is a great find. The cats enjoy rolling around with these toys and stealing them from one another. It‚Äôs a great buy for multi cat households.
"These brushes are so cheap but they are cheap quality. I go through one once a month maybe. The brushes are not as hard as the original one but I didn't think they'd be that flimsy, feel like sometimes it's not even brushing my teeth."
Not bad for the price.My 16-yr old was able to trim his beard fine.I was able to trim hubby‚Äôs hair during thisStay Safe in Place time. (Check YouTube for videos in how)Clicking on & off dif comb levels was easy.Did not try personal nose trimmer function.
you don't need much but it cleans almost anything.  Bought it to clean bugs and sap off of my car and did the job fast and easy without hurting paint.  Also used to clean interior of my car and did a great job as well!
"Decided to try this because of all the hype and good reviews. However, my fish will only chew on it a bit before spitting it out. Even tried not feeding for a few days, then feeding it again. They refuse to eat it"
"The desk is quite good compared to the price spend on it, has memory to save standing and sitting position of yours so you can switch between them multiple times a day easily,It takes an hour to assemble, I wish manufacturer could reduce the assemble burden"
Got this for my 13 year old. She hasn't put it together yet. She started organizing it and spent about 30 min and called it a day. I'm hoping she does eventually get back into it. She normally loves this type of project.
"As stated, flavor is terrible. Like chewing on toothpaste, gets super bitter quick, I didn‚Äôt notice an effect from the caffeine. This could be due to having a high tolerance, but nonetheless would not buy again unless they come out with new flavors."
"I love this sharpener, I like my pencils sharp for detailing and this does the job. You can just put it in you dont have to hold the pencil it does it all by itself. My only complaint is the tips break off."
"Good quality balloons for the price! Made an 11‚Äô balloon garland. Thickness of the balloons holds up to transport and manipulating without damage or fading. Ended up not using the large 36‚Äù balloons because with only 2 they were unable to blend well, which is the reason for 4 stars."
Adorable stuffed monkey here and it‚Äôs the perfect size to sleep with or snuggle with for the littles!My grandson loves him.I was expecting a bit more here (better material and stuffing) for the price but he loves it. Your basic large person sized stuffy!Cute!
"I was a little worried based on some of the reviews, but bought it anyway. The chair is exactly as advertised. The arms are full 4D adjustable, has lumbar fully adjustable lumbar support. Casters are very smooth. No regrets with this chair, would buy again. Very comfy!"
The second I got these out my cat was using them. They are like a bowl of M&Ms to him. He can't pass by it without trying it out.I might buy another set so he has one in every room.
Great little kit for teaching kids to sew. Had everything needed.  Only complaint is that the felt stickers are too difficult to peel for young children. I had to take over that part so the thin sticker film wouldn‚Äôt get pulled off.
"These socks work so well for me - totally relieves the 'heavy' feeling which comes with varicose veins.  I read somewhere that the lower compression socks are just as effective as high compression socks - I believe that is true, going by my experience."
"These come up in a search for 3x5 but they are not, they are 3x4.  When I watched 3x5 spiral bound index cards the come up as Amazon choice.  I would think they would be the size entered on the search.  Amazon did do a refund"
"I bought this very last minute for a halloween costume and it came in in time and it was as expected. Fit very comfortably, has pockets, easy to get on & off. Although, the white is a little more see-through than I hoped, I just popped a slip on underneath."
"I love these pantries! Not so high cut to look like granny panties, but not so low that it lacks coverage. I‚Äôve got the baby pooch in my belly and these cover it. They stay in place well (don‚Äôt crawl) and are very comfy."
Worked well.  I have a few low spaces and put them up for some tenants as a reminder.  Worked out well.  Large enough to be noticeable but not obnoxious.  Came in a two pack and not terribly expensive considering they are two stickers.
Purchase these for use at school classroom.  Blew them up and they barely stay inflated for more than an hour.  Cheaply made.. if using for one time quick use they work.  Do not purchase if needed for extended period of time.
"These retro sunglasses are very nice and universal.  They look good on my husband, as well as my 15 year old granddaughter.  They appear to be of good quality and they are easy on the eyes in the bright sunlight.  Try these...you won't be disappointed."
"It's so flat, the ribbed edge doesn't stay up so my dog can't nuzzle in there like it's shown in the pictures. It's just flat and lacks padding. Nothing special to this at all, it's just like any other dog bed."
"I still haven't found any shirt that wicks heat away. That doesn't allow sweat to transfer order to the garment.  But its Nice color. What happened to pockets? None of these outdoor pullovers have pockets. We need POCKETS IN OUR SWEATSHIRTS, PULLOVERS  AND OUTDOOR WEAR!!"
It‚Äôs for my German Shepard I love how it‚Äôs so thick and heavy but the shrink wrap around it took me half hour to get it off (I didn‚Äôt have scissors) but it came in a lil velvet bag-well made
"My child was wearing this mask about once a week, and I was washing it once a week. After about a month, the wire for the nose started to poke through and scratch the skin. This would be a great mask if not for the wire!"
"HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR A FEW YEARS NOW.. I NOTICE MY MOOD IMPROVES AND HELPS BUILD CARTILAGE BEFORE IT BREAKS DOWN... SINCE I EXERCISE, LIFT WEIGHTS AND EAT RIGHT... THIS HELPS ME WITH MY JOINTS!GREAT COMPANY TOO... AND AT A GREAT PRICE HERE!!!"
"My 4 month-old mini Schnauzer loves this. I have not yet seen her go so crazy over anything else (including peanut butter, bananas, and blueberries!) as she does with this. I love that she still loves playing with and chewing on the rawhide days after."
Works as described!  My arm kept hitting our door knob when the door wasn't open all the way and causing a bruise on my arm. So this door stop helps keep the door back rather than hitting the door stop and bouncing back. Answer to my problem!
"I love this mat.  It's made for getting out of the shower and not so much at the door.  There is a no skid bottom, and the color and the chihuahua are so perfect.  I love it."
"Great leash that has VT in correct team colors (often the burnt orange and Chicago maroon is tough to achieve). Very strong/thick leash, we got the 6ft long.Only gripe: it only has the team colors only on one side, all black on the other."
"Nice idea but what active dog would you think will keep these on?  Measuring their foot width and length of leg is very important but growing pups, if you can get them to keep these on, will need the next size up. Maybe an old dog would like these!"
I have been using CASIO calculators since I am in elementary school. CASIO is a great brand that makes amazing quality products. This particular model is not the exception. I am very satisfied with my purchase and the ease of using this calculator. I will always recommend it.
"Works very well and is amazingly quiet, did not alarm our dog at all. Charges quickly. It also comes with a wide variety of attachments as well as &#34;extras&#34; such as nail trimmers, scissors and comb. We are quite pleased with our selection. Would highly recommend!"
This was a gift for my boyfriend and he loved it! H loves the smell and the way it makes his beard feel. So glad I took the time to research this and read the reviews! The Koozie was a plus!
"Its wht you would expect from a $12 dollar hat. It took a month for delivery and it had creases when I opened it. Overall not a bad hat, but you wont be getting a New Era, or Mitchel&Ness Quality."
My dogs has sensitive paws when he walks on hard surfaces and contact allergies.  Tried this before his walks the past few days and his feet seem very well protected.  Easy to apply.  Doesnt seem to have a bad smell at all and non greasy afterwards.
This shirt is the best!! Fit's like a dream and the image isn't cheap or flakey. I've worn and washed this shirt several times and it hasn't shrunk or discolored at all. It shipped super fast and arrived before I expected. I would absolutely order another print from this company.
I would've given this a 5 star if the cones came wrapped. They were just handcounted and thrown in the box. We're in a pandemic. It's unsanitary. I used some that came with the machine I bought. The floss sugar was great though
"My wife uses this in medical practice to take quick notes.  It provides a solid writing surface for the cards.  Levenger products always have a high quality, and this is no exception.  I probably will buy one for my pocket, too!"
This is actually a great product. I‚Äôve had other ones that broke or just didn‚Äôt charge all that well. I like how it‚Äôs only 1 cord bc others I have purchased had 2. It‚Äôs just the perfect length also. Plus you can‚Äôt go wrong with the price.
"Loved the style for my son, but this sweatshirt looked terrible after 1 wash. The already small fit got smaller, and the material inside prevents you from trying to stretch it out. My son still wears it but it's definitely not as good quality as Adidas usually is."
"Just received the package, it doesnt have the amt. of product on the bag.  When is the best time, if there is one, to ingest the mixed product? Use it anytime or have eaten before?  I am anxious to use it although first time trying it.  Thanks."
My corgi pup was strangely not concerned with eating her food. Only wanted treats. Bought the sprinkles and started using it in her kibbles. She started eating. Although slowly but better than not at all. And over time she now eats at a normal pace. Thanks for the help.
I‚Äôm not sure what they‚Äôre asking for with ‚Äúsheerness‚Äù but I give it 5-stars because this is my favorite pre workout.  I‚Äôve tried a number of them and this is one of the only ones that gives me that extra push to go hard and really push myself.
First no instructions included.  Four batteries come with it - you assume you need to put these in so it works.  Had to checkinternet to find some type of instructions - then had to send e-mail to company.  Not worth the hassle
"doesnt hold its pressure, the length from cock ring to hole is pretty nominal i imagine most it wont reach and will just pull 1 ball out. the metal balls are a nice touch but not enough to bother using because of the deflation"
"Purchased for a summer funeral.  Perfect fit, looks good.  Simple, cool for summer. Flows when walking.  Went from funeral to steakhouse for dinner, completely versatile.  Super comfortable to be in all day.  Hated to take it off!"
We got this for my daughter for college. It is holding up to the abuse of travel and usage by engineering students.The size is perfect for home use and you cannot beat the price. We bought another for a home office and I have no complaints.
"These banks were well made and as described,  the kids loved them, easy screw on plate for when the bank is full and need to cash it in or make a deposit. Great way to save for the kids and learn responsibilities"
"I got this plush for a friend, and while it took a bit longer then expected to get here, she loved it! So that‚Äôs all that matters to me. I‚Äôm also unsure what the characters name was, all I know is that he has freckles."
"Love this outfit and get lots of compliments. Ordered a LG and it fit perfect I'm 5'5"" weight 155LBS. I'll be purchasing more of these in different patterns. I work in the financial industry and this is a very nice business attire outfit."
"Quality wooden toy. Perfect for my now 1 year old, she‚Äôs enjoyed it for several months and I could see it being a mainstay for years to come. I love that it also acts as a container for the toys and is easy to carry the top."
These little raptors are absolutely adorable. Unfortunately I have been invested in other painting projects and have not gotten around to stripping the miniatures and painting them. However this is a future product and when I get around to painting them I will update my review with pictures.
This is a very solid scooper. The plastics are all high quality. The design allows for good control. The teeth on the scooper are able to pick up waste well. It seems to be easy to clean so far. Can recommend
"I got this for my rats because they kept knocking their food and water bowls over, this is one of the best products I've ordered on amazon! it's so easy to clean, great quality, not flimsy at all, and super easy to put on their cage! Great product definitely recommend!!!"
Got this and it seems to be working. Rub on a bad knee and the pain seems to have eased. I cautious but I really think it's working. I think I'm impressed and excited. I will recommend it to my family and friends. Received a discount to write a review
Took 2 of us to get the poles in and the covering pulled tight enough for the Velcro to seal. Hope I never have to take it apart‚ÄîThe canopy was easy to add.Looks nice and pup seems to like it so that‚Äôs the point.
Product fit as expected. Color was great and was thick enough to make it not see-thru. Was worn for a spring dance recital performance. Purchased another one for my older daughter for dance practices as it is practical for both uses.
"Had to re-wash everything after I used these. My husband's clothes still smelled sweaty and dirty and my sheets were dingy and didn't smell fresh. What's to like? I threw the ones I had left in the garbage. Total waste of money, time and the water to re-wash."
This is a very cute shirt and looks good on.  Do yourself a huge favor though and order it one size large than you think you need.  It does run small.  Looks best with a skirt I think due to how the waist looks.
This is a great item.  It works not only for pets but if a guest comes over and they just sit down on it.  I could not breath.  As for the mat I have two because the one for the couch made them go to my chair.
"These are really easy to use on baby teeth. Great getting the baby used to scrubbing/cleaning their teeth. It‚Äôs a soft silicone material that is soft on the gums and easy to clean. Easy to keep in a diaper bag, bathroom, or Anywhere."
"Not As Advertised on Amazon.  My package arrived in time but it did not have either of the solutions, only a plastic lens wiper like &#34;Leegoal Mini Sun Glasses Eyeglass Microfiber Spectacles Cleaner Brush Cleaning Tool.&#34;  Thankfully this is not the Amazon norm."
"These things are great, mechanical design is amazing, they all are some kind of homage or reference to other things the designers love and it shows it the themes and names. This guy I'm guessing is a homage to Roger from Tekken, I'd expect a raptor to come next."
Cut very small. Had to return.  I have a few other harnesses by the same maker and they fit my dog great.  Ordered the same size but it was much too small.  Decided not to order a size up.
I love everything about this leash the color is beautiful I love how it has 2 handles it comes in handy with trying to train my dog to walk on a leash it‚Äôs a nice thick durable leash I highly highly recommend it
"The item in the listing's picture is bright, vibrant and well detailed. The mat that I received looked like they were running out of ink. The colors are very washed and the image quality is horrible.  The mat itself is good quality however that doesn't forgive the misadvertised item."
"Perfect!  My five year old loves unicorns and zombies and this couldn't be more perfect for her.  Nicely made, good materials, and came way faster that it said it would.  Awesome!  Hasn't left my daughter's side since it's arrived."
They were a bit small for standard size cards.  I didn't get to use them but not worth sending back.  They should be made to size standard sized cards so no matter what type of cards you are trying to protect will fit.
Bought it to cover the unattractive cracking of my chair's arm rests. Was a bit difficult to squeeze onto but I eventually got it to fit. Been many months since the purchase and the cushion isn't flat and still very snug without much shifting.
"Great toner, great company! After my first toner arrived, I noticed that the print was very light. I contacted the company and they promptly sent me another one along with a postage paid return label for the defective one. The new one works great!"
"These compression socks are comfortable but they do not stay up my thighs. I find them slipping down towards my knees, which is not good for me. I purchased these to help with leg swelling during pregnancy. I prefer the Jomi brand instead."
I really like the product. My hair is much thicker after two months of use. I will continue to take the vitamins. I have not had any problems with the vitamin. I don‚Äôt like that I cannot buy them in a store. That would be much easier.
"I was so happy to try this out. I used it to shave my underarms and it  took off my skin.I tried it for my legs and it was terrible, but still had my skin on my legs. I am not happy with this product at all."
Looks nothing like the picture. The dress was very frumpy and did not flow as shown. I am almost 5‚Äô9 and typically I receive many compliments in this style but it fit nothing like my other dresses. Sent it back
"This product came quickly, it had very appealing packaging and was completely intact. Using this Lactation Support supplement,  I was able to pump at least 1 more ounce than before.I'm definitely going to keep using it until I'm done breastfeeding."
"I bought several of these to make matching sets with card holder, note pad, compact, and password notebook for friends and family this year for the holidays. Easy to pick favorite colors for everyone and all are cute and useful."
"Absolutely beautiful collar! My dog‚Äôs last collar was a beautiful embroidered one from a vender at a festival. When it broke I couldn‚Äôt find anything nearly as beautiful until I found this. He gets compliments all the time, and looks well taken care of :)"
I love this little storage cart! It was easy to put together and looks really cute. I love the little double ended screwdriver included for assembly. I only wish it had come with four of the little caps in case you don't want to attach the handle.
I love the design of the bag and the pattern of the material. I don't like the size. It's too small for school use. And too small for a shoulder bag. Makeup bag is about all it's really good for..
I just replaces my old cartridges with theATOPolyjet Remanufactured Ink Cartridge Replacement for HP 62XL 62 XL for Envy 5540 5640 566 and am very pleased with these ink cartridges.  The colored ink is the correct color and shade .
"The flight controller was very easy to setup and install.  I had to remove all the connectors so that the profile was smaller as I was installing in a 3 inch drone but if you have the normal real-estate on a 5 inch drone, it will be very easy."
"Flat as a pancake on arrival, so easy to store the extras before using, these puff up nicely when wet and are an effective exfoliation tool. A good fit in the hand, with a convenient hanging loop. A great addition to the shower or bath...."
"Traditionally speaking these cards are not postcards. They are more of what i'd consider notecards. I mailed one as a postcard (no envelope) and it did not hold up well. However, the pictures are cute and the stickers are great. Just use an envelope."
"Cat Loves Them, Soft Enough for Kitty to Pick Up and Fetch!There are some that look like soccer balls and they are not as good, because those black strips off the soccer balls can come off.  These are plain, making them safe."
"These are the same size as the originals, but I hoped they would handle sidewalk cracks better than my original wheels, based on description and other reviews. They are actually worse - actually hang up at the bottom of some ramps."
"If you are looking for Frye quality leather , (I have many)... this purse isn't for you... but for 52.00.. it is quite nice... just the color gray I was looking for, pretty fast shipping too! Overall I really like, and would recommend!"
The sweater itself was pretty but the sizing was off. The placement and size of the arm holes were way too small for our French Bulldog puppy. Sizing up just made it too long and still had the arm hole issue.
I have been able to get a lot more if my chores done thanks to this product. My back and legs DO NOT HURT and hasn‚Äôt bothered me since I started taking this 1 month ago. Really happy with this product. It‚Äôs  definitely worth the money.
"It‚Äôs good for maybe a school supply, but the one I was looking for was a lot less flimsy.  I checked the number also which was pink pearl 101 which my other eraser was, but I guess they are made differently now."
Very nice wooden puzzle. It is finished in a satin clear coat. The wood is a nice light color. The edges are crisp without being sharp. It fits together very well and would look nice as a desk top item.
"The one with the heart came with something sharp and extra between the straight part and the chain and it can hurt any ear. Also, another one came almost broken just in a thread (so at the end it was broken)."
"i already left a review, but i'm happy to do so again.  i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this very inexpensive ink replacement - the clarity of the colors is wonderful.  you can't go wrong for the money."
"I have a bald head, so the vibration pads actually touch. When fully charged and applying the head for a vibration massage...sit in a relaxing chair and let the full span of charge run down as it vibrates and relaxes nerves. This is my second one since 2005"
These are the best highlighters I‚Äôve ever found and the grey is my favorite- usually I have to buy a multi color pack of 5 or so to get a grey one. Love that I found this alone. Definitely worth the money!
"This facial scrub is chunks of cacao nibs and the hydrating mask. The pieces of nibs are so large they mostly just hurt my face, its like rubbing pebbles on your face. The hydrating mask feels very nice, but I can't get over the pebbly nibs."
I couldn't be happier with this journal.  I love it.  It is beautiful and very well made.  It was packaged so well.  It was in a nice box and wrapped in tissue paper.  You can tell they take pride in their products.Thank you SohoSpark.
"Inexpensive and works. I'll update if I find that the toner doesn't last very long, but so far so good. I bought my Dell C1760nw specifically because I knew I could order third-party ink at this price for it. Definitely worth it."
This is not a safe chew toy at all. My dog snapped the antennas off in seconds! Don‚Äôt waste your money like I did. Throwing it the trash rt after I post this review! Zero stars if that were an option!!
Kids opened it up and was so happy and could not wait to see who was going to get spit on first cool gift and you can put white shirts on them add a little dye to water and instantly fun tie dye shirt for the loser
"Decent optics with the lens.  However, the frames broke with less than 6 months of light use.  The frame is made from some kind of cheap brittle plastic.  Why they didn't use cheap bullet proof nylon is baffling to me."
Love it so much but here are the cons. I wish he would be able to hold the ball other than that no complaints. Most people know that his body is stuffed and he doesn't have feet. Would buy again
Would‚Äôve given it 5 stars but the chain is so flimsy that I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs going to break very  soon. Giving it to my DIL who‚Äôs a music therapist & it‚Äôs perfect design except for the chain. Lovely back story about the artist/ musician
The product was used prior because the box was not for that item and there was no product or size label included. Bad repackaging. If I would‚Äôve known they were used I would not have gotten them for a Christmas gift. Not cool
"These were a perfect fit for my granddaughter. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give 5 stars is because the description said ‚Äúmicrofiber‚Äù and I guess I was expecting something a bit thicker than normal nylon stockings. Overall, very pleased with these tights"
I bought this for our cat's ... They seem to like it ... They are rescue cats and both have been declawed so they are confined to our house ...They have been walked around our yard and been out on our deck ...
"[[VIDEOID:d374936097be280b683e586c3fc467c4]] I know it‚Äôs pricey but it‚Äôs so well done and so detailed. the Joker is the most favorable character that‚Äôs why he always sells out, it was a birthday gift/ grad gift for my daughter. She was so happy when she got, she loved it."
"My kittens are 6 months old and still pretty tiny. Just one of them knocks this down. I have scrubbed the windows, adjusted the upper suction cups‚Ä¶nothing works long term. This thing is a total let down! If I kept the box, I‚Äôd be sending it back!"
"The decorations were as said, very pretty. The balloons that spell bride were smaller than I thought and they did not float. The ring ballon and all the latex balloons did float, beside that pretty happy especially with the price."
"This is just as cute as it can be! I bought a small for my 11 year old chihuahua 5 lbs, she is spoiled and likes to be carried. She was to small for it. I gave to my BFF for her Chug, 8 lbs, fits her fine."
This product is a great alternative to coffee or an energy drink. Easy and quick to take and no jitters or bad breath! My husband is in the military and this is great when he‚Äôs in the field or has to work late.
"Along time ago I purchased a Kodak printer to save money. And now that it's really hard to find, I decided to look on Amazon and not only found it, but it's even cheaper than the originals! So now I get to keep using my older printer!"
"I love the style of this purse, as my old one is similar. The crosses on the purse and wallet did not match each other, as pictured.  The colors of the two items were two different shades of green.  Very disappointed for the price I paid!"
"nice looking boots.... they just won't stay on.  i take my dog walking, and every 10 - 15 minutes i have to stop and adjust the boots, so many times that i finally just leave them off..... total waste of money, we're not even using them."
"Not as WOW as I had hoped. There is really nothing wrong with it, but its not special, either. If I had seen it in a store, I probably would not have purchased it. Delivery was quick and hassle free."
"OMG. These are horrible tasting. They have a vitamin nasty flavor. I literally have to choke them down. I bought them years before. They weren‚Äôt great, but not this bad. I thought they‚Äôd improve, nope. They are 1000 times worse. Why are they still allowed to sell these?"
"I like the print.  I am 5 feet 7 inches and it is not nearly as long as pictured.  In fact, it doesn't even come to my ankles.  I kept it, though, because it is a nice print and true to size."
"This was great for my old lab, kept her going for a few years. She had lymes disease and hip problems, this really helped. Unfortunately she passed away, but she was 14, and had a great quality of life, thanks to these pills."
"So far, so good! I really like the color variations especially when traveling. The bristles start to bend after short usage, but I may/may not brush kind of hard. I also like that the colors aren‚Äôt rubbing off or leaking on my hands!"
"My kitten instantly ripped this off the hanger and shredded the feather off the puffy ball.  Nonetheless, the puffy ball is now his favorite toy.  If you sold those separately I'd buy them.  The door hanger was a great idea but it just came apart too fast."
"I have been ordering this calendar for the past few years, this year I again ordered two. I noticed that there was a musty odor to the productIt was as if it had been stored in a damp cellar. Not happy this year!!!!"
TONS of balloons included with this fun gamer-kid birthday set. It really set the mood for my son's party and he loved the 2 mylar balloons that were included. We didn't blow up many of the balloons but we will use them in the future. Highly recommend.
"I get so many compliments on my tape dispenser!  I love this little chicken, but I do wish it had a little more weight to it.  I have to use it carefully when I want to dispense tape."
These are fine at removing the lint & fur but when it comes to time to tear off a sheet for a new one it is very difficult to grab just one sheet plus they don‚Äôt tear easily at the tear mark.  I won‚Äôt be buying this brand again.
They are definitely a good set of toddler fork & spoon! Haven‚Äôt had any trouble with rusting so far with multiple cleanings. They grips are nice and big for little hands and my kid is getting better at using them more often.
"I like the product for my Quaker‚Äôs & conure, but upon receiving the items, there was a strong chemical smell to them. Had to air them out before use. Sturdy enough. Not very soft, but my birds don‚Äôt really care about that."
My children played this with the neighborhood kids and it was so much fun to watch.  Hilariously entertaining!  Some of the neighbors passing by loved it and had to comment on how much fun it was to watch. I absolutely recommend!! Worth every penny.
My nearly 9 year old loves this thing. It is large enough and pretty soft. She does not mind that the legs and arms are skinny. That is the character. It is holding up well. I just don't like minecraft!
"It's a calendar. What can you say? My granddaughter wants to take control of her life and schoolwork and requested a calendar large enough she can write on it. While it is useful as a desk pad, she hung it on the wall."
"It worked. It made bleach. You could smell the bleach, and you could witness it's cleaning power. After six uses it ceased to function. Of course it is past it's return date. We feel cheated. Do not buy this junk."
"They hurt a little when I squeezed them on. But when I didn‚Äôt it fell while I was asleep.  I would recommended to wear 24/7 its so light weight I forgot them. They look cute too, looks exactly like the photos."
I love the smells it comes with! And it‚Äôs very useful if you don‚Äôt have a Tub but you want a luxurious bath experience. My ONLY complaint is that it dissolves son quickly also the smell. I‚Äôd wish it last longer so my whole bath could more relaxing
"If you are looking for a thin protective film that does not leave a residue, this works really well. It is a very good value as well, almost 500ft!!  This is exactly what I needed and I'm very glad to have found this!"
I found some like this at a gas station and I fell in love. They are easy to build and honestly are super fun even if they only take 5 minutes to do. I display all mine on my desk and they are just too cute
"Terrible design that simply will not do the job.  Mine had tiny suction cups that immediately fell off and would not reattach, the plastic was warped and is cheaply made.  The concept is good but in practical application it won't do the job.  NOT recommended."
"This seems like a good quality kennel. Pay attention to the dimensions, because it is much smaller than I realized it would be! We have 2 baby Chihuahua's and they're cozy now but if they get much bigger, it'll be a tight fit in there. Lol"
"I'm extremely disappointed with this bag. In only 3 days, the zipper broke. I barely got the chance to try it out before it became unusable. I wish I could give zero stars because I'm so upset. Do not buy this!"
"Everything you need to set up comes with this kit. including a way to pump up the balloons, and stick them on the wall.The ballon glue works well, but you need quite a few dots. the bigger balloons will fall. I ended up using some tape and it held fine."
"power supply and foot pedal are not the best for any skill level and the 55 inks are very watered down. suggested indian ink. guns, needles, grips, and all other supplies are outstanding id use this company again for certain items."
I like how well made and colorful it is. It was a nice way to pass some time with a satisfying end. I plan on buying some for my grandchildren. Hopefully they will enjoy them as much as I do.
"I bought these to wear while weight lifting since I bent a couple of my cheaper rings, I didn't want to risk bending my wedding ring. The smaller width looks much better than the thicker silicone rings I think and I like being able to stack different colors."
"I got these shirts to workout in but they were way too short. My sports bra was longer. These shirts are more for teens. Maybe young adult. Way too small for me. I had to return them. Overall, not a good fit for me."
"I didn‚Äôt want to spend for the $150 version of this (looking at you, ugmonk!). This is every bit as good as that product and worth every penny. Thoughtful attractive packaging even. It feels so solid and ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù -thank you for this wonderful product!!"
"Good product, very convenient.  The case is pretty sturdy.  I don't think the connectors are very solid, however.  I have to hold the power leads just so, and be extremely careful not to even bump them or else the unit loses power."
These are beautiful earrings.  They are lightweight.  They arrived in a timely manner.  They will occasionally slip through my ears.  But they have never fallen out.  A small rubber earring stopper will keep them from slipping.  I would recommend this product.
I ordered the medium the first time and they were too large. I reordered the small and they are too small. I don't think the pants are made according to the proper waist size. I am returning the small as well and will not reorder.
"The first thing I noticed upon receiving this black vest was the high quality of the material (inside and out) and the heavy duty zipper.  I think this vest will outlast me.  Great purchase - when it arrived, I immediately went online and bought the khaki colored vest."
The litter box is very nice and big. What doesn't work so well is that the poop you can remove easy but the cats urine is stuck to the grill so it's difficult to clean. Other than that the cats love their box
I bought these toe rings so that I would be able to wear shoe thongs in the summer. Sad to say I have some corns on a couple of toes that prevent me from wearing thongs because I am so self conscious of them. A great buy!
I have had this for a month. Very easy to clean was easy to assemble. Our 150 lb. Great Dane uses it when we are relaxing on our back deck. I have noticed the support bars are bending a little.
I am 5'9 and weigh 170. The dress was too small and too short. A XL would have been perfect. The dress is super cute just runs small. The quality is perfect but the sequins do fall off but they are not noticeable.
My son loved playing with this for hours in the car and he liked that he could learn how to solve with apps he downloaded to help be batter at. He has so much fun with it! Good for long car trips or traveling in general!!
This is perfect for my special needs 4 year old to practice properly holding a pen and writing. It's simple and easy for him to use. it causes absolutely zero frustration. he enjoys playing with it and I enjoy that's actually giving him practice while he thinks he's playing!
"I really intended to return the brace because itwas not a good fit for me. I had a serious family illness, my sister, and I totally forgot to return it with in the 30 day period. So I will just have to keep it, but that‚Äôs my fault."
"I love teapots, the ocean and lapel pins so you know I ordered this the minute I saw it. The teapot is larger than a quarter and the cup is smaller than a dime. They are connected. Great piece! Cute! Appeals to many different interests. Great gift. Very happy."
Pros:Work with the Super Soaker Nerf - Shotwave Blaster.Hasn't broken in a dozen plus water fights.Holds a decent amount of water.Note:It's harder to use with smaller kids because the gun is heavier due to the amount of water that it holds.
I was so pleased with these when they arrived. They are substantial in size and one branch is more than the equivalent of an entire package of braches sold in the pet stores. My Chinchilla loves these and one branch will last him at least two weeks.
"Although it's smaller than I thought it would be, it's a good value for the money.  I think it needs to be bent a little to stay on but for what I paid, it's worth it!  Nice braid detail too."
Had an allergic reaction to this supplement. It made my face turn pure red. Felt like my whole face and ears were on fire. Had to take benadryl immediately to stop reaction. Then tried Mercolas Vit D3 with K2 and did same thing. Would not recommend either product to anyone
"This toy was a big disappointment. The manufacturer info, box label and all writing in Chinese. The car has an awful monotonous whining tune and the right arm broke and just hangs down after 2 weeks. Please do not gift this toy unless you want to annoy the parents!"
"The small size is nice and price is thrifty, but  it is difficult to turn the dials for individual characters.  Each time I adjust the date, I get some blue ink on my fingers.  I have had stamps before that did not do that."
The photo is adorable but the actual product doesn't quite match. The fur is a bit shaggy and no matter how much I try to reshape the ears the stay pinned back pretty firmly which doesn't look like a St. Bernard.
I used this bag for birthday treats for the kids. Great colors and quality. So much easier than wrapping. They were sturdy little bags and stood up nicely in rows. Everyone loved getting their treats in these colorful bags. It is very spacious and effective.
"These were a gift to my adult granddaughter who is a kitty ""Mom"".  They were a gift for Mother's Day and she loved them--""Beautiful opels, grandma.  Thank you so much.""  She liked them.  Nicely boxed and arrived promptly."
"My godchild is so into horses so I picked this item to give her for Christmas. I was so surprised when I opened the package!! She is going to adore it, and best all, she has a little sister who will get one to!!"
I replace digitizers professionally and decided to review a few from amazon.ProsWorks flawlesslyUses 3m adhesive so no problem stickingRemoval tool is among the best in the marketConsThe camera hole didn't line up exactly but the camera works still.The Home button was a little crooked and needed straightening.
Arrived safely and quickly.Madoka and Homura and careful sculpted and painted to bring to life these two goddess.The pieces fit together to form a yin and yang symbol and hold hands.My only complaint is that they are not sculpted to their platform. They scoot around.
We got this for my nephew for Christmas. My husband and I are in the Air Force and he loved seeing the planes when he visited us in Nov. so we got him this for Christmas.  He liked it a lot.
"Love this mask, Ordered Medium size for my QH. Mesh is fine enough for no seeums, lightweight, stretchy, been on my mare for 2 weeks on free choice pasture and round bale.  I would like about 6 more but cant find size Medium anymore."
"Doesn't completely slow my Rottweiler down but helps for sure. I've seen better for slowing eating. The maze-looking bowl would be better but I couldn't find an elevated maze bowl. The height is perfect though, which is important. Your big dog must have an elevated bowl!"
GREAT CONCEPT WITH BEING RADIO CONTROLLED.  THE PERSON WHO USES IT IS 90 AND BLIND.  SHE HASHAS DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING THE BUTTONS FOR TIME-DAY-DATE.  THEY PUSH HARD AND IT SOMETIMESTHROWS OFF HER GETTING THE TIME FIRST.  A GREAT WATCH AND SERVICE WAS GREAT FROM THIS SELLER.
This product is nothing like the picture. It was so thin and poorly made. It wouldn't keep my dog warm. It looked like it was warn and walked 100 times. So thin. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this to anyone. It took almost a month to come.
This stuff is amazing but do yourself a favor and buy it for $24 at Lowe‚Äôs.  It‚Äôs way over priced on Amazon.  Mix it 1:1 in a sprayer and spray it on house/deck then rinse off with water.
"First we had round miraflex for my 2 year old , and lenses popped out all the time , then we ordered the squared ones which were way too small in person ( I mean the lenses not the frames )"
"Straight junk. Sloppy fit to such a point that they hit the arm of the motor extension. The blade holders were junk also, didn‚Äôt fit whatsoever nor would they stay in place. Sloppy low grade waste of time and money!"
Love the original haakaaa so I had to get another one! This was my first time trying the lady bugs and they were really nice! Great for kind of more discrete use and baby doesn‚Äôt seem to kick them off so much lol
"So for some reason the print head doesn‚Äôt pull in the ink from the print cartridge for 2 colors.  You can manually fill it and then it will work for a little while, but it will stop when the ink becomes low and gives the printer system error."
This game is fun for kids and for adults! What I really like is that I can play this as a family game or as a party game for adults.The game play is a little like the classic Memory but with power-ups and specials that make every game unique.
"It's an awkward fit. The torso fits fine, the right kind of baggy and feels soft, but the arms are very short. I'm not a lengthy person in my limbs, so it's a bit odd. It's like three-quarter sleeves. I still love this sweater, but the sleeves are something else."
"Excellent quality. Very heavy duty for plenty of traffic. Pretty heavy, definitely will stay in place. I bought two so my power wheelchair would be able to climb over thresholds.  Best price I have been able to find  for a double door threshold."
I have a maltese puppy turned 1 year today 11/2021 and he loves these. They are grain free & made in the USA which is important to me as well. I probably will be buying these for years to come.
"Product arrived on time and was what expected.  Have been using for about two weeks and it has been a definite help.  However, I'm still experiencing peeling but not nearly as bad as before.  I believe with time it will restore my thumbs to mormalcy."
"Bought this as a gift for my cousin, who's more like a sister. She loved it. I had promised her I would get her her very first journal to write in. She felt it perfect, she loves elephants and the material and design is very unique."
"I only have a handful of Pop figures as I try to only get the ones that truly capture the essence of the character and not just characters I like. These Duck Dynasty characters are SPOT ON! They nail the typical dress, beard characteristics, and accessories."
I have dry skin and this moisturizer saves me from the annoying peeling! It is not light as lotions but doesn't feel thick at all. It is hydrating and makes my skin soft. Will keep it as a regular moisturizer.
"I was disappointed that there was no crinkle in this tunnel.  My cat loves another tunnel that is a short length like this one, but is not intrigued by this one at all.  It was packaged fine and came fine, but it seems to have little play interest."
"I bought this to keep in our trailer for our Yellow Lab. It has worked perfectly for us. Several days worth of food fit in the cooler, the height of the bowl is good, and it's easy to carry and clean. Great product!"
"I don't think these would make good ping pong balls, a definate seam on them . But I bought them for my beardie to play with and he loves them, pushing them around all over. So worked for what I needed"
"The most comfortable thong I have worn--ever.  I expected a slightly closer fit, but the soft fabric still fits really well.  The cut and lightness make all day wearing thoughtless.  So far the material has held up to laundering."
I use my stainless steel milk cup to store evaporated milk in the refrigerator. I like it because it is large enough to hold a can of milk and has done so without leaks or rust. I would buy it again.
Good product over time it will brighten skin after about 2 months it is really noticable and people will see it.  I also like it because I have difficult swallowing pills having this in a spray form is perfect for me.  Thanks
"Beautiful Masquerade bracelet ring set. Fits as expected. My son is dressing as a female. His girlfriend is dressing as a male. This set is the perfect addition for his costume. Dainty, stylish, beautiful and comfortable to wear for a long period of time."
"Absolutely adorable! Would have given it 5 stars, but I‚Äôm not really liking all the extra string that hangs down once it is tied. Other than that, it fits like a glove. Almost feels like it was made for me!"
"It‚Äôs a great toy, but my dog who isn‚Äôt a super heavy chewer has already started taking the nubs off. I‚Äôm finding little pink bits of rubber around my house. It won‚Äôt last too much longer before I grow tired of cleaning it up."
Worked like a charm! Used this to go trick or treating with the little ones. Very bright. Loved the multiple settings. Easy to click on and off without having to take the headband off. Received lots of inquiries about where I got this from from parents while out.
"No crash, great vitamins! Gradual caffeine effect (not a Big Bang like coffee or general energy drinks) and cherry is my fave! Kinda like a tangy fruit punch flavor in my opinion, since I don't normally like cherry!Blue rasp is a very mild and light flavor, also good!"
"This top is a nice addition to any wardrobe.  Really nice finish to the fabric.  It quite thin, which allows it to hang nicely and flatteringIt's quite small thru the body, not as roomy as I would expect for this style."
"I have only seen double sided socks in the hospital. I had 3 pairs of these socks, still in the wrappers, in my room, when I came back the socks were gone. Who else, but the aids would have taken them?"
Bought these for the family so we can change out our filters weekly.  Good deal for them.  They are even $5 cheaper now as more companies make them.  They are as good as any others that we have received from other companies.
This item was ordered for a male who likes playing with real boats as well as models. The toy works perfectly. The remote controller is efficient and the battery life is reasonably long. IT would be better if they were sold as couples.
"Daughter is going to love this. Wasn‚Äôt sure how big it would be and for the price, even though it said 14‚Äù I half expected it to be a knock off or something wrong considering most squishmellows are ridiculously expensive on here. Nope this is perfect! Love it."
"I purchased these for my office wall at work, by my desk. The back is 100% sticky, so that's great. They went on the wall easily are holding up my items nicely. I like the shape and you can make a straight or odd-shaped design as you wish."
"When it comes to scales nothing is more frustrating than inaccurate results, this scale I would trust down to. 05g which is fine for food but if you were actually measuring jewelry with this I would get one that can measure down to. 001g"
"Great dog food, but I wish they made a version with smaller bite size for my little dog.  She has allergies and I think this grain-free food with the fish oil is helpful for her, but the bites are big for her since she is only 10lbs."
"I have had this type of belt for a while now.  However, the new buckle is far bigger than the old one and sadly it is painful to wear.  Other than that the product is fine..just wish they did not get the bigger buckle."
"I brought this for my daughter for Christmas Eve and she looked adorable, it's was perfect. I ordered the size according to her age group. The dress went passed her knees, and I paired with some thick red leggings. She loved it!"
"I really love this little purse!!! Really nice quality, perfect for shopping etc. I use mine every day, no longer carring that large purse weighing me down...also love the cell phone window in the back...I don't even have to remove my phone to see who's calling, etc....highly recommend!"
"Great value for a good quality collar. The background of the leopard print with pink bows is a little paler and a little more pinkish than pictured, but I still like it. Very Betsey Johnson! I'd buy a matching harness if they had any."
"My Guineapigs wouldn't eat this, but they did line their cages with it. It was missing that fresh smell, but I thought, it's got great reviews, maybe it's just me. After seeing the Guineapigs reaction to not one, but two boxes I know it's not me. What a disappointment."
I bought this as a joke for a friend who turned 45 and I was very surprised with the quality. I was expecting a lot worse for the price so I was very excited when it looked and felt great!
"I assumed ""non-slip"" meant there were grips on the soles. Nope. I purchased them as a gift to my son after he moved to a new home with all wood floors and a staircase. I wanted to help keep him safe, and failed. Not a good outcome."
Really cute but I wish the suspenders were of better quality. The straps were fraying almost immediately after putting them on and they wouldn‚Äôt stay at the size we adjusted because the metal adjuster is too loose and slides out of place. The outfit itself fit well and was adorable.
"I'm 125 lbs and wear a size 2-4,  and the medium bottoms were way too small. Not only that, but the material isn't typical swimsuit material and the waistline isn't stretchy.  The top was very poor quality as well. Sadly had to return."
"At 5 ft 8.5 and 125 lbs, I'm usually a size 0-2 in dresses, but found it hard to take deep breaths in the green dress(I'm an A cup). It's beautiful, though. If you are really petite, this could be the perfect dress for you."
"Bought these for my 7 year old. They fit perfect. Different settings are very cool. Only problem is when you remove them, if you are not very careful, the lights and inner layer come out with your hands and getting them back in correctly is very time consuming."
"The interlocking cubes I received were packed well and delivered quickly.The cubes themselves would not interlock as they should, but when I emailed the company they quickly gave me a refund.  I would use Wizard Math again due to the good communication."
Great product. I bought one for my girlfriend for a very cheap deal here on amazon. Her size is 7.5 and I ordered the same in Wide. It fit her so well. She says its very comfortable and the style in WHite is simply great. Rockport Rocks!!
"My new puppy loves this ball, it‚Äôs small enough for her to carry around, but too big for her to worry about Choking.She loves these ball...she even carries it around the block on her walk..I will keep ordering these for sure."
Got for my sons bday and he Ryder and all his pups he got also.. great size. Only thing he gets annoyed aboht is ryders hands don‚Äôt fit onto the quad handles easy so he falls off a lot. Other than that great toy
"Really beautiful. Bought as a gift for my fiance, I picked the longest delivery date & it still arrived 2 days so he got it as an early christmas gift as aposed to a new year gift. The colors are beautiful & it comes with felts to keep from scratching."
"Very well made and great looking tie. Looks like I spent much more. The great thing is that this tie has a kind of rugged look that can be dressed up or down. The color was spot on too. Don't hesitate, great buy!"
I have a Pomeranian that is 5 ibs and a mix that is 9 lbs.  I could not find any dog bowls I liked.  These are perfect and so cute!  The sides are lower and give my dogs access to their food easier.
"The neck tie is separate, fabric feels a little cheap and costume-y. It also fits a tad smaller than expected, I would probably size up. I usually wear a size small, I ordered a medium. My arms are a little long, so the sleeves weren't quite long enough."
"Great patch! It came earlier than expected, just in time for my Halloween costume. It looks just like from the movies. It's a good size as well. I didn't order the Velcro version, but I don't mind sewing it on if it doesn't iron on."
I bought one for each of my kids and they both have so much fun with this activity book. I love rhay it calves so many different topics and can keep the kids entertained for long periods of time AND is educational!
Started a furious rant review. Ending with a frustrated review. Christmas morning tears because pieces were missing. Finally after an hr found the missing pieces inside the main body. Crisis averted but definitely not the way to start Christmas morning.PS he loves it.
Since money is not circulating due to the Covid-19 plague banks have stopped printing money envelopes for Christmas.  These work well but I would not trust the envelopes for mailing - too thin.  I would place them in a standard envelope for mailing.
My mare has Cushings disease and cannot sweat to cool down in our hot California climate.  This product does help.  She still needs frequent cool water baths every day when temps are high but she  recovers quickly.
The holes need to be bigger or closer to the ground because both of our cats stepped on them and they squashed down like a folded newspaper.  We gave both of them away.  I do not know if they are easy to clean because they were never used.
"The adhesive that comes with these is not nearly strong enough to support anything. It did also come with some screws and we ended up screwing them in, but we purchased for the ability to simply adhere them to under our counter for charging phones."
"This is a nice add on to my band collection. I did wish the scarf was more of a satin feeling , but nevertheless you can still use the brackets and put your own scarf on it! Definitely worth the price!"
Light up toy bought to distract my son. Build quality is cheap. The most annoying part is the obnoxiously loud sound it makes. I had to open it up and mod it to stop the sound but kept the light up function.
"I was very happy to find these replacement boot liners as they wear out much quicker than the outer boot shell.  Duct tape repairs to the old boot liner was not an option (but I tried it in desperation!!!)  Found and purchased the boot liner, fit perfectly....problem solved!!!!"
"It's a great cart. Sturdy, easy to put together, looks good, but you can't push it more than six inches on a carpeted floor without one or more of the wheels locking. I guess I'm going to have to go to the hardware store and buy some non locking casters."
For the price it was GREAT!!! Feels of good quality and has many compartments. The tan is a bit darker than the picture but I love it in that color. The straps could of been made to secure an adjustment in a better way but overall I like this product.
"Turns out the cat doesn't like collars, unfortunately, because this is a break-away collar, the cat has no problems ripping it off to accommodate her discomfort. The quality is fantastic. Just might not be the right buy for every cat owner...."
"I got this for my 3 rats who were 6 weeks old when I adopted them. Pet stores typically do not carry rat food for young rats, just one type. My rats love this food, they prefer it to another popular brand."
"Love this game, and I'm very happy with this container.  The game is completely self-contained, and stays together when it's in my suitcase or knocked of the shelf.  Just don't let anyone try to put it in the recycling."
"It is very easy to assemble. It is a bit bigger for my desk (63""X31"") because I have 2 monitors of 32inches and 34inches. But it fit well at my bookcase. Easy to adjust the width if you want to fit less files."
"I bought these to add a bit of shine to some folders for employees. I was excited to receive them. Imagine my surprise when there was no shine at all. There is nothing iridescent about them! I will use them because I need too, but I am very unhappy."
Great for F‚Ä¢R‚Ä¢I‚Ä¢E‚Ä¢N‚Ä¢D‚Ä¢S Lovers.  I have it on my desk at work. The only thing i would change is the clarity. In most of it the words and pictures are very blurry and distorted. Also not as smooth for my mouse as i hoped. Over all good though.
"I was looking for a tape dispenser that wouldn‚Äôt move when I ripped the tape off, so I could use it one-handed to secure the bubble wrap when wrapping my products for shipping. This is it!! It works amazingly well! Thank you!"
"I wear a medium too, ordered a large bc some said it runs small. I returned for a medium. It is so cute layered with a cami or flowy top underneath and some jeans or skinny dress pants!! Love love it!!"
"I received my hat and was very displeased that the plastic string covers were crushed. I thought ok no big deal, but then I tried it and and it smells horribly!  It has a chemical smell which will definitely give you a headache.  I will be returning this."
"Exactly as advertised. It collapses or expands. It appears to keep things fresh. The only issue I had with it was when I push the button, the lid doesn't open. I have to push the button and put my fingernail in the seam to open the lid."
My 5 year old granddaughter loved this stuffed animal purchased for her birthday. It is super cute and just the right size to cuddle with. Pugs are her favorite so this was a perfect gift for her. It is nice quality and a good value.
"It's just the right size for a lanyard and the colors are vibrant! The ""purple"" is a little more pink than I think is normal for the Nonbinary flag but I don't it's that big of an issue. It's still purple-ish."
This was a gift for my granddaughter who loves the ‚ÄúBaby Shark‚Äù song. I was a little surprised the eyes were hard and not sewn on material. It was difficult to tell by the photo. Other than that it‚Äôs a cute stuffed animal.
"My Granddaughter Loves it! I keep it inside the house. She uses it daily. I figured out that when I cant find some of my things, or her things to Now go look in her trunk lol she puts everything in her trunk. I Love it. Will buy again :)"
"I am not an expert. I am a guy who just recently started to use moisturizers with the encouragement of my wife.I like this product. Non-oily, nice scent (not girly or of perfume) and a little is all that's needed. My skin does look better because of it."
My sons gave me this as a Mother's day gift and it is a very nice bag. It is roomy and can fit every basic need to go in a med size purse. I  went and bought the key chain that matches the bag. Nice.
"Well made and cute costume.  One thing to be aware of, the feet on this costume are a little longer than expected. This may make it hard for your pet to walk comfortably in the outfit.  Otherwise it is very cute."
I was afraid that the inexpensive price translated to an inferior item...Not so! This scooped Flip (our Beta) up with ease. The threading appears sturdy...the netting itself is thick enough to hold Flip yet thin enough to let all the water drain through. Just perfect for our fish family member!
"A little on the expensive side, but better to have and not need, than need and not have.  Blood Clotting Agents should be in everyones first aid kit.* Please let me know if my review has helped. Thank You.*"
[[VIDEOID:bdad5bccbe7f7c7b2ceb562b220967ae]] This is great! Helps keep the food isolated to one location making clean up way easier. Suction works great! The only thing is the grips and suction cups stick out being white and not clear or black but that‚Äôs minimal. The quality is great glass easy to clean.
fun simple. little hard to get to stay stuck together. lots of build options and uses. make little bunkers or cap the tops of walls. Id say buy two packs to start with to get the most out of them.
"My students enjoy finding the correct letters and looking at all the sides of the cubes.  Sometimes, however, they get a little frustrated and keep looking at the same ones over and over, rather than selecting a different cube."
"I love it, and this is my fault but I didn't read through the measurements. Picture was a little deceiving. It's very small. Still good for the price and still size appropriate for my 8 month old but passing on the warning"
"Outfit, made of thin fabric, arrived with marker marks on the fabric, despite that it was in a zippered bag inside a box. Contacted seller who offered a $5 refund if the marks did not come out after a washing. Marks did not come out after washing."
"Initially when I saw this border online, I thought it was just ok, however once I received it and put it up on my bulletins, I absolutely fell in love! The colors are beautiful and the quality exceeds what I expected for the price!"
"I absolutely love these, I wear them all day at work for 8-11 hours on a busy unit. My feet never have felt so good. I've ordered more!!! You can't go wrong with the price and I've gotten so many comments about how awesome they are."
It says you can build them in different ways. But really you can only build vertically or lay it on its side to be horizontalSlippery and wabbly. Gonna get some stuff to try to turn it into a scratcher and see if the cats care about it then.
"I like that it shows my cats are emotional support animals but it's too big on my cats neck. My boy cat can hold on it cause he's a chubby adult but my girl cat, no cause she's still a baby."
This is unbelievable quality for the price. I bought it because it looked adorable but I was so excited when I got it and realized how really soft and pretty it actually was. I can't wait for it to be cold so my baby can wear this!
"I love this product on some of my furniture pieces.  Anything ""ribbed"" or not of a smooth texture, this mostly just snags onto and doesn't necessarily life any hair or fur off of. However, on the smoother types of fabrics it works phenomenally."
"My 2 1/2 yr old grandson loves this! All he has to do is the twist the head and it changes to the dinosaur. I love that they can take the abuse of the littler kids, and they are made with better construction."
"My cat is a VERY large male tabby, around 17 pounds, and it seemed to fit (extended as large as possible) but then he really looked like he was having trouble breathing... I will buy a small dog harness I guess."
"My dog loves these ! No chemical odors, no fake rawhide stench either. He spends a good deal of time on these, and it satisfies his need to chew for a while. These havent caused any stomach issues for my dog, and he's pretty sensitive to diet changes."
I tried this product for the first time and I felt energized after drinking it.It has a clear taste. The instructions guided me pretty easy on how to use it.If you need a little more energy to get through your day its good.
Like it but do not order the small it‚Äôs still too big for my twelve pound coton.  Too bad a waste cannot return.  Nice I wanted it to work it did not.  Be careful when ordering size. Nice quality collar.
"Out of all of GW's specialist games this one's a fair price for a quick afternoon of fun. A lot of their games can be well overpriced, but I feel this was solid. I'd like to get more expansions for it, extra planes and all that."
"Bought this for a maternity milk bath photo shoot, however it didn‚Äôt turn out to be ‚Äúmilky‚Äù enough even though I used both bottles. However, the scent was very nice, so if you are looking for the purpose for an actual bath, it‚Äôs great."
[[VIDEOID:3d29ac61da53383896ba330ef0a3213d]] This sand is very fine. I like how the water separates from it with ease. The color is like a light beige. I included pictures and have a white sheet on the tank as comparison. I would definitely purchase again and recommend.
"[[VIDEOID:9ee008b9b7d927b16324a54ed2118b01]] My 3 dwarf robos are obsessed!  They love sleeping in the bottom part and taking turns going down the little slide.  It‚Äôs so cute to watch!  This thing also arrived fully assembled, painted beautifully and no splinters sticking out ready to get you or your critters."
"Like some of the other reviewers I've also been using these for the treatment of Hypotension & POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome). These were recommended by my doctor, they help keep my blood pressure up and I use them to increase my overall salt intake which has been low."
This really helps getting rid of loose hair on your pets.  We have 2 small  dogs & a large long haired dog.It's great for taking the loose hair off before it winds up in the house.Thanks for yur product.
"The toys are well made and don't seem to be falling apart anytime soon. The only thing to keep in mind is that, if you have a picky cat, they may not play with all the toys. mine only likes the silly worms."
This set has a lot to offer as you can mix and match with complementary sets. You also have an aray of play-doh you can use with it. However it is very hard to clean and it does not flip as it states it does.
"This Bankers Box is an excellent buy. It is sturdy, with hand-holds for moving or carrying. The lid fits nicely and these boxes are great for filing, storing, moving or shipping. Files, letter and legal will fit nicely in these bankers boxes. Made in USA."
"Love them! Wanted strap on vans for the longest time, but couldn‚Äôt find them anywhere. They are comfortable even for wide feet. I ordered a size 5 in kids for me because I have small fit and fit just fine."
I love the calendar it has stickers and alot of extra pages but it only goes up to the month of July.  It's not a full year so I had to buy another calendar. This is why I gave it 2 stars
"Great price, but in this case, you really do get what you pay for. I cannot get a dark printout out of this product. Genuine Brother toner & drum worked great. This one is inferior, produces inferior printouts. I will not buy again."
I love this thing and it feels great to use. Build quality is top notch and better than anything else you could find around this price range and it's fully modifiable with software and accessories that the miyoo community provides. I recommend it to anyone who needs that retro itch!
"It is not alcohol resistant on smooth surfaces as Petri dish or cultural plates. Pity. Tech support of the company confirmed it. So if you need a marker to use in a tissue culture, it is not your choice. On the rough surfaces, it is ok."
I love it.....It is just what I needed for the space below my TV. It is beautiful. Much  prettier than the picture. I'm very pleased with my purchase. The music is perfect. I highly recommend this clock and the seller too.
"These trillion shaped earrings were very pretty, although so tiny that I couldn't put them in my ears and put the back on them without help from someone else. Perfect for a second piercing or perhaps for a very petite person or child."
"I like the size and look of this scale, but it consistently weighs about 8 pounds light, no matter how I adjust it.  It's not worth the hassle to return in, so I'll just junk it and try another."
This product works great for stubborn constipation.  It doesn‚Äôt contain Senna or Cascara Sagrada.  You have to experiment with how many you need.  I found 3 was too much.  The only natural product that has worked consistently.
"These are far more lovely in person than the pictures show. They're weighted well and I have yet to stop rolling them around. They will land heavy & some edges are quite pointy, so mind any small hands (kids lol) trying for them."
This poster board is just what I needed.  I'm making a light box and these aren't glossy so they don't reflect or cause shadows iny photos.  I'd recommend buying them if you would be using them for photography.
"Great dome with cool look (L in pic).Ready to use right out of the box.No bulbs included.I've had no issues with this.I won't be using both sets in the pic at once. I will probably use this one for my other reptiles but so far, my tortoises approve."
"Seems okay. I don't think the capacity is accurate. I bought this for a s500 drone build. No gimbal, No camera. Just the drone frame and flight controller. I can't even get 10 minutes of flight with very light and casual flying. I may return, and get a better battery."
"Bought this one for my own new keychain, and I love the feel of it in my hand.  Plus it is lightweight...no heaviness on the ignition switch.  It's slim & so dosn't make my pocket feel 'full'.  It's a lovely silver.  Very pretty."
"Completely cheap quality.  Wire couldn't be more thin - dog broke it with one small swipe of his paw.  The transmitter on the collar completely fell apart, the cap fell off which holds the batteries in, then the batteries fell out.  Don't buy this."
. i love this bracelet. the beads are of high quality. the fit is smooth and sleek - not tight or pulling. the color is beatiful. i am very happy with my purchase. it was reasonalbly priced and shipped quickly
Good lables. Easy to peel off also. Can not write with markers. The extra paper on the side makes these sticker rolls not a fit for my printer so I cut the extra mm off. But its not the labels fault. Labels are good though!
This helps so much to relieve pain and pressure when I‚Äôm sitting in my office chair for work. I broke my tailbone and can‚Äôt stand any pressure. This is soft and comfy and is easy to use. It can be cleaned easily and I‚Äôd a great value.
Pros: The quality material feels durable. It comes in a nice case  and pouch for easy storage. It also has extra lead for the protractor and mechanical pencil.Cons: No instructions. The language on the back of the pouch of rulers isn't in english.
"I love it, my cats, not so much. A cute toy, very well made. Easy to fill with water, does not leak. I placed on thefloor for my kitty boys, and they ignored it. Still a great toy,  kids may  like it."
"I first discovered a hot water bottle while in Kenya on Safari. They put them under your sheets during turn down service, so by the time you get into bed, it is toasty and comfy. This is the first and only time I've experienced this and u knee"
"My kids are in a shark phase, so I thought, why not. To me they seem a bit wierd, but my kids LOVE the fact that you can take the bones out of the shark. LOL! Bob (the Great White) is a favorite friend in our house now!"
"The low price on this was great for a traveling charger for my Palm, but it is advertised as a syncer, but it doesn't sync at all.  A little disappointing, but for the low price, I couldn't complain too much."
I am impressed with this foot file . I have been so sick of the dead skin on my feet but I have always had my doubts with this type of device . I am so glad I gave it a try . My soft baby feet are back ‚ù§Ô∏è
My sister-in-law saw one of these in a gift shop.  It was half the size of this one and they wanted $20 for it.  She was very happy with the one I bought for her on Amazon.  I recommend.
My daughter absolutely loved this for Christmas. The only thing I think I can say that she was disappointed and was the necklace broke. I gave her the extra one I was going to keep for myself. Other than that great Christmas gift for her
I bought one for my newest grandson. I loved the soft silk like texture. Nice quality and affordable price too. That helps a lot! It‚Äôs so cute I ordered 3 more for me and my other grandsons. I hope they are just as good! Thank you!! I‚Äôm a happy grandma
"The flavor of this vanilla power is the best I‚Äôve had, but the other day I noticed maggots in the protein. Idk if it was just this tub that was bad but idk if I‚Äôm going to be purchasing this product again. Woulda been 5 stars."
"This product is not meant for puppies. My 6 month old Pomeranian ripped it in seconds. The shoe toys are extremely small and and bad quality for the price. Way to expensive for teeny tiny shoes. They should be used as decoration, not as toys."
"Great Product...with a gentle pleasant smelling cleaner.The wipes seemed a bit small to me at first about 1.5&#34; in diameterBut after using them a few times, I found that the size works out well.After getting some ear wax on the wipe you can discard it without feelinglike you're being wasteful."
Heats up just fine and works as expected. You have to take some care making sure your laminating sheet is as square as possible so that it doesn't feed in crooked. It makes a difference in the last 1/3 of the laminating process.
"strap is attached across the middle of the patch instead of having one side hung at the upper corner.  Only useful if you don't mind the strap going in front of your other eye, because that's where it ends up."
"For any Spidey fans this is a great toy. Certainly not something that will be worth thousands in the future, but if what you want is something nice to place on your mantle or desk this will work just fine."
"Doesn't work for my dogs. I bought this because my one shepherd is afraid of tall people and will bark like crazy behind the couch.  This did little to stop the barking, which really stinks since son is home for a while."
Love these miraflex glases! My daughter picked out the color which I am not completely in love with but it was her choice. The frames hold up to everything my daughter put them through. She outgrew her first pair. The shipping was quick and the order was accurate.
"Love love love. Finally a sock that comes to knee high, is warm, and doesn't slide down my calf.  I will be ordering more. I was so tired of other companies saying socks were knee high and they never were. These really are and aren't tight !"
"The Hateful Eight was a movie I enjoyed immensely and when I saw these figures and how well the detail on them looked, I knew I had to have them. So far only bought the Quentin Tarantino doll but aiming at buying all of them. He looks incredible"
"Just as advertised, It holds the checks, although the back page of the 3 to a page checks is very thin, it slides into the pocket in the checkminder cover, it is so thin it probably will tear out before long. But that is not the fault of this product."
"Of course the rings are 2 sizes: they simultaneously go around different parts of the body. It's a tight fit but once on, it  stops circulation real well and stays put. Getting it off can be a challenge. Using some lube helps the process."
"OMG, these things are HORRIBLE!!! They don‚Äôt for a minute stay on the handle. Trying to get the used layer off?? Do not start me. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! It has ine star because I couldn‚Äôt give it zero."
I love the coat. It was what I wanted. Fits bigger than expected. Especially sleeves. I read people saying they were long and thought this coats for me I have trouble with sleeves being too short. But they are long on me. Pleasant Change for me
"Good storage of power, and  nice control of powder being applied to the puff.  Unfortunately, the powder puffs are undersized and disappointing.  I ordered the smallest quantity of 3-1/2 puffs from Amazon  and found them far more acceptable!"
"This little wallet has nice construction. It's lightweight, has good stitching, is nice and compact. I was hoping for more of a dark, wine-red with a light sheen. This wallet is more of an orange red than I like, and has a shine. I'll return it."
"i really like my new heating vibrating pad.  When I got home from work tonight the vibrating mode does not automatically turn off and I tried to turn it off myself, it would not turn off so it is constantly vibrating.  It was working fine before this happened."
"I tried it on once I got it and it is Asian sized so buy bigger.  Tried it on a few days ago and the string came off the top, which would be an issue for most but I'll just put a stitch in it and it'll be fine."
"I got these for my Type 1 Diabetic son to keep glucose tabs in and then keep them on his bags and jackets.  They are way too hard to open, especially if he was feeling low.  They are even hard for an adult to open."
I'm very dissapointed with this dinosaur. I was expecting a larger sized dinosaur instead I got a tiny dinosaur. I'll never order this brand again. I dread giving this dinosaur as a gift to my son because it's such a dissapointment. Very low quality as well.
"This is a good product, but it is not budget friendly. I wasn't anticipating such a small package.  I will likely not be purchasing this again. I do recommend it, because of the quality of the whey. If you can afford it, buy it."
The outfit is perfect for the Florida light winters. I thought is was a knit sweater but its actually a stitching that makes it look like a sweater. The small runs a bit on the larger size. I love the color and hoodie.
"Searching for paper straws in my quest to eliminate plastic. Looking for straws that will hold up to one can of soda. These taste like cardboard and get soggy fairly quickly. Too bad, I liked the color, I should have known they were too good to be true."
These are quite comfortable.  I really like the adjustment pieces.  That is a nice feature to add and help make the product more usable to more buyers.  Nice orthodic for the price- when you include the adjustable pieces.  Great idea.
This thing actually does a spray which is nice that it‚Äôs not a hard blast. My kids can shoot me in the face and it‚Äôs more of a spritz. The shield part is invaluable. It‚Äôs what you always need in a water gun fight.
Love these cute pins.  I bought them as an accent for a bulletin board for my daughter.  They seem to be of good quality and sturdy.  The color is just as pictured.  Love the petite size.
"I had one about 5 years old that was giving me headaches.  Sometimes it worked fine, other times not. Finally I bought this one, a newer version of the same one I had. Plugged it in and works wonderfully."
I purchased this as  a gift for a friend. I am disappointed that the picture of the puzzle is a photo inserted with the puzzle pieces. The box is plain. I had to pay for shipping and pay again now to return it.
"These have been a waste this year. I bought these in September for my classroom. They do not erase easily, especially color dry erase markers. Even after using special dry erase remover, the boards are still streaky and smudged. Total waste."
"Perfect for on the bike and carrying on your shoulder with he strap; however, using it as a backpack is extremely painful. The bottom board digs into your back and has no padding for comfort. Also, my dog already tore the mesh on the front from her excitement while biking."
El primer saludo de esta plancha fue una quemada en la frente calienta al instanteLa pr√≥xima vez que la valla a usar pongo otra persona hacerme el pelo  para no volver a quemar mi frente ah√≠ me di cuenta que si funciona bien por la quemada ü•µ ü§£ü§£ü§£üíãüëçüòá
"Two of the bones had NO marrow. The  other three had between a 1/4 to 1/2 marrow. A heads-up, the bones are coated with a very sticky greasy substance. Once on cloth, carpet, bedding. clothes, etc... the dirt will stick and cause staining."
"It doesn't fit at all.  I will no longer order from overseas. If you're making clothes for Americans, you need to use our sizing guides. Also, I can't send it back as it would cost more to ship it back than the product costs. Products"
they are so short the Penny ones barely have enough to fold over the ends.  In fact so little that you can see the penny inside. In photo normal penny wrapper on right. The one that came is on the left.
"Size runs small. Get a size up from what you wear. I bought for a trip to texas in a few months. Trying to lose weight any how. If I can drop at least 10 more pounds, it will fit great."
"The tray is just what I wanted to keep my passwords organized, but the cards themselves are only slightly heavier than printer paper.  I would replace them if anybody out there made decent ones, like they used to be."
"The little cups are very helpful for collecting urine, although I wish they weren't plastic. I do love that the tests themselves are very small and simple and create a lot less plastic waste than your standard home pregnancy test."
This turned the area around my dogs mouth red for months. It took forever for their stained hair to grow out and for the red to fade. The food also smelled terrible. FYI I have one white dog and one black dog and both their muzzles were stained.
"I regularly use Tegaderm while carrying for my invalid wife.  Purchasing small quantities from local sources is just too expensive plus this size is not always available.This purchase was very economical, arrived quickly and was exactly what I expected."
"I do hope this company can measure last and toe box for American market. Super cute,on trend and cool. So sad they didn't fit. I feel if they can fit we gals from size 10 up you will have a great many sales."
"Compared to other statues from this company it's a heck of a deal, looks great, great detail, great sculpt, no complaints, even though Captain marvel seems to be one of the least loved marvel characters, maybe that was why it was so cheap...lol. she looks great though"
"This is such a great, different, large Christmas card.  I love it.  And it doesn't get all tangled when it's opened.  It opens very easily.  I'm sending it to a special friend and I know she'll love it as I do.  Thank you."
"They move around unless you are them in , which I didn't want to do .They are not very comfortable ,and I'm just not crazy about them .The only good thing , it keeps the mask out of your mouth."
I've tried many different brands of paper in the past.  This paper was definitely the smoothest softest paper by far.The contrast of the darks on the whites are just brilliant! I would reccommend getting the larger roles however asyou don't want the experience to end so quickly.
"Very happy with these casters. Perfect for not marring the wood floor, and don't make a loud racket when I move my chair.  I will be replacing the plastic casters in my other chairs with more of these great casters shortly."
"I had surgery so I needed loose fitting dresses. This dress is what I was looking for. The print is fun too. Being short, I wish they offered petite sizes too. I bought small & it is a little long."
Used this to stand my vintage Barbie I got from my late grandmother. It works perfectly and she looks so pretty. The price seems a little high for something so small and simple but it works for standard barbies well.
"This item is very well made, but I was not sent a silver colored one like what is described in the listing. They sent me a brass colored one. I am very disappointed. I specifically needed the silver to go with the rest of my silver accessories for my costume."
"I was most worried about the sheets feeding in properly and jamming the printer. Not once did it jam. I started with one sheet at a time, then did multiple. The prints came out beautiful! And the price is 1/4 of what this would cost at the office supply store."
"These are very breathable for my job. My little girl took two from me also. I didn't wear it to see if it falls down yet, but they all do. I think it just has to get adjusted for your face. Nice fabric!"
The ducks pictured are not the actual colors received! So disappointed!!! Whoever heard of a black rubber duck!?? Oil spill awareness perhaps? A red rubber duck?! Red tide warning duck?!! Stupid navy blue rubber duck?! Such crud do not waste your money...
Pretty print. Nice that there is a built in slip. So so small. I ordered the xl (I‚Äôm normally a M in skirts) and it was uncomfortably tight. If you are over a size 8.... I wouldn‚Äôt buy this skirt.
"These are made very thin, which makes the plastic picks very bendy. It can be hard to get a good sturdy picking. On the other hand, the thinness makes for better getting between teeth, but still not very sturdy. The flosser works good, a little loose but holds up well."
"I got this collar at the recommendation of a friend. I like that there are 3 modes. Sound, vibration and shock. I don't use the shock but the sound and vibration work great to train my dog. It comes with the charger so no batteries needed. Would recommend."
"This helped my aunt when she raised 2 puppies this summer.  We were able to keep them confined as we were remodeling her new house. In addition, it makes clean up easier! Just add a tarp under it for indoor use!"
This mask is made horribly. The eye slots are way to smal and to close to the nose. So if you want to be able to see then you have to have the bottom ( chin part) up over your mouth. I would not suggest buying this to anyone.
"I ordered this product and it was not delivered as stated.  I needed the shirt , so placed the order a second time.  I got both shirts in the same package, even though was told the first one had shipped.  Love the shirt, but now have two."
They are quite hard to get on if your dog does not like touching their paws. I got the front ones on but the back ones didn‚Äôt fit. My dogs paws are just too big even for the biggest size!
"This was one of my granddaughter's birthday gifts, and she liked it, although she wasn't absolutely wild about it.  (Maybe one needs to be an official elfin fan?).  It's sturdy, a good weight, and she liked that the rider elf was held on by magnet."
"This is NOT just for paper! I use it to cut deco mesh for my wreaths. It is definitely a game changer! With the use of this product it cuts my prep time to just minutes! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT, it will change your life!"
"They look super cute in any cage, even in a natural themed cage. Really nice pop of color. My hamster love chewing on it and one of them stands on top of it to look around. Great purchase all hamster owners should consider it for their pets."
"Just needed some readers but I had to go with the ""retro vamp"" cateye look for giggles. These are very comfortable, work great and provide variety for a very, very good price! Colors not quite what I expected but leatherette cases were a bonus. Fast Shipping!"
"This is the best non prescription pain cream I have found. It really warms up nicely and helps with my sore muscles.I like that it has natural ingredients. The odor is a bit strong and bothers my husband, but I think the pain relief is worth it."
"Both my cats come running for these, and one of them snatches them from me so fast he bites my fingers. This is a pair of cats that has no problem turning their noses up at many different things, and who agree on very little."
Purchased this for our home after we had a lightening strike and took out all items that had small circut boards in them.  We have four units running from the base and have never had a complaint.  We use the intercom function all the time.
Absolutely adorable and great quality!  My only problem and why I didn‚Äôt give 5 stars was that they were huuuge!  We had kids ranging in age from 2 to 10 as well as adults and they didn‚Äôt really fit anyone!
If mechanical pencils were swords this would be the samurai sword of mechanical pencils. Every time I use it I feel like it listens to my every movement. It is the best mechanical pencil I‚Äôve every used. I would definitely recommend this to everyone drawing.
Bought this for my husband and he loves it!! I‚Äôve used it a few times myself and it really has helped! We both are gym freaks and always sore and stiff and this thing has really been an awesome tool to help with recovery!
"Installed this for mother - she loves it, the dogs adapted quickly.  She is in Alabama and this kept out the heat... love the slide in panel so it can be closed when you like.  Would buy again."
Bracelet runs small. I wear a 7.5 and this bracelet is one that you will be aware you have it on because of the snug fit. A lot of little stones fell off as soon as I started to put it on my wrist.
"I bought this document camera for my classroom. Unfortunately, it has very a very poor display quality. It is very blurry. I tried to enhance my picture, and that just made it worse. I am unsure where you could use this, but it‚Äôs definitely not in a classroom."
"These cards were as clever as they could be given that there were no 3-dimensional additions. I prefer the handcrafted greeting cards, so I was a little disappointed in this collection. But they were a good value for the money."
"i drink with water (doesn‚Äôt change how it taste) ,, can drink without (don‚Äôt taste nasty but it‚Äôs a weird good) but be careful it stains very easily ,, kind of hard to get out ,, the dropper is very helpful"
A little gritty but easy to take and MUCH better than any chewable and actually has a slight sweet taste.9/21/19  Finally now has Amazon Prime on this item! Even better since I purchase this every month. Received in 24hrs!!
Very nice fit and work nicely with the Samsung S6 I have!!!  They also feel to be quite warm but cannot confirm as the weather has been mild since I got them.  All in all a very nice product
I had a lot of coins lying around and finally decided to purchase some wrappers.  I looked several places before I went on Amazon.com and found exactly what I was looking for.  Cannot beat the price for the quantity of wrappers I got.
"Found single envelop at local store.  Was sad when the buttons, which tie close, tore from all my use.  Happy to find available thru Amazon.  Great envelop for travel. Put schedule n ticket in the front pocket for easy reading and access."
"I chose these bookends because of affordability. I was happy to see they arrived wrapped in plastic. However, I was greatly impressed that the metal bookends came with base pads! Now my books stay upright and my  furniture is protected."
"Easy to operate, and does the job. I used it only on small projects, (not many sheets), and since that's all I will be using it for, It works for me. I didn't bother witht the electric coil inserter; it is quick and easy to do by hand."
"You just gotta love Amazon! This is exactly as pictured. The belt is stretchy so it will fit most waists (if you're a curvier gal, I'd stay away though).  Can't beat the price and it's a classic look - win!"
I love it because I can put it in my back seat and open the sides for my cat. I have a 20 pound large cat that hates traveling but he seems to like it since it's pretty spacious :)
"The rats enjoy it. The only issue is that it is super flimsy, and I had to zip tie corners and levels together. Also, the tray at the bottom has very short sides and there bedding and poop can fall/roll out onto the floor."
Beautifully crafted. You can tell time was taken to make sure this watch is made for satisfaction. Comes with a beautiful wood box and extra links. Got this for my brother for Christmas and he was amazed on the craftsmanship
Not very effective because it is too stretchy so it doesn't pull shoulders back much.  Not very invisible because it puckers up in back.  Not very comfortable because it doesn't breath and because the rubber is constricting like wearing a dozen very large rubber bands.
Great white board for the price. I‚Äôve had it over a year now. I love to use it for math classes and science classes to teach myself concepts as I study and work out problems. The board is a great size and cleans really well.
"Thus product is perfect for my messy teacher desk! I can put my essentials inside for easy access. It comes assembled, sturdy, and not overly large. I really love it! I received this product for free, but it is my honest opinion."
[[VIDEOID:686d13050f7fa91f2471b6153c441f70]] This set is great for matches anywhere. It is compact and sufficient in size at the same time. Pieces stay put and the clasps hold the board closed. The magnetized feature works well in the car and provides stability during normal play.
Looks more like a sports band. Way too small I ordered my size like I would anything else. Hardly stretches & couldn‚Äôt even fit over my knees. Got this because I thought it was pure black & looked like the picture. Disappointed
"Paint Brush would be great if you do Far East type calligraphy or writing. Children & older people need stable hand movement. Painting in between larger area's, would be fine. Finish fill, needs to be done with stiff brush tip."
The card is the one in the picture. I received it in mint condition. I don't currently play pokemon the card game however I do collect cards and this one is great in my card binder beside a Blastoise holo and Venasaur holo. It's great! Buy it!
"Daughter & family bought an RV, needed some games to occupy children 7,8 & 9. Perfect board size for the vehicle table & checkers really do adhere to the board -even around corners & sliding between players. Board is a bit flimsy but appropriate for the price. Would purchase again."
"This was a  fun 3 pair pack of novelty glasses, they were actually just frames but I loved them!  and my friend couldn't stop laughing at me when I was wearing a pair to a Christmas in July event.  :-)"
"Not only are they are beautiful picture.They are a great size, blank on the inside so you can write what you want.We live in FL so I love having FL pictures :)  at least beachy pictures on my cards.These are great and a good price as well."
This product is great!  I have had eyelash curlers in the past that pinched me ... OUCH!  Not this one ... it's such a pleasure to use ... lightweight too and the color makes it easy to spot on my makeup table!
I failed to notice the actual size of these balls. They are listed as tennis balls. They are NOT tennis balls. Not in size nor in material. I was very disappointed that I am not delayed by having to find & order a correct item.
"My 1st graders first valentines day extange, suprizingly he had a great time making these. You get enough for the whole class (depending) and some extra for the rest of the family. We had so much fun and he even got to keep one for himself. These are great!"
"I purchased this drum unit to replace an official brother drum unit. It has only been installed for a couple of weeks, so I can't speak to longevity, but the printer functions as normal and the print quality is great. The printer (HL-2280DW) accepted the drum unit with no problem."
"This gets stuck on door knobs all the time like any other key chains, most I‚Äôve owned before would‚Äôve already given up. Surprise these still hold up great. The dark colors makes it hard to spot any stains so stay looking nice."
"This item works for at a great price. I  tried several more expensive saves and creams, this in my opinion is the best I have tried.  For the price you should give it a try, it has a money back guarantee. What do you have to loose?"
"I bought this dinosaur for my nephew he is 9 years old and he love it because it walks in different directions, shake their hands and move the tail like if it was real. The control remote is easy to use."
"I have problems with arthritis and inflammation in my ankles, it always hurt to walk. I started taking this, 1 per day, and I  am blown away with the result.  Some days no pain and others very little. I highly recommend this product."
Looks even better in person. Good quality and color. Be sure to remove the black cording protecting the cords before buying a hard plastic cord cover for the floor. This will protect them from being walked on or rolled over by a chair.
I can‚Äôt begin to tell you how pleased I am with the quality of this banner. The shipping time was so fast and I love my banner. The price was just the best. I will definitely be buying from this company in the future
I received a lot of compliments at the concert that I wore this dress too! It is a cute dress!  I had to wear a thin stocking like shirt under mine. Not a full top but half. I felt naked with my arms exposed. Loved this dress!
My cat loves these they are his favorite toy right now. He loves when we throw them and will even play fetch. They are sturdy and easy for the cat to see with colors. It has a piece inside that rattles when you shake it
"the lanyard, was easily frayed. it came apart after only a day or so. This happened on over 20 of them. The plastic clip would break or the lanyard would come out of the clip. This product is not good for youth."
Already have this in my collection and wanted to buy one more (an unopened brand new product)Took the risk on buying it here at a great price and the result came out great.A brand spanking new product in perfect c10 condition.Thanks!!
"The image pictured is a 36 yard roll of tape.  Not a 5 yard roll.  For 5 yards, that's a hefty price, considering a 36 yard roll cost $44 last year.  Imagine my surprise when I received a 5 yard roll..."
I've been looking for this type of ear plug for some time now. Was so happy to find them. The little metal carry case is great for travel. I am very satisfied. I received in just a few days from ordering which was wonderful.
"This product arrived in an undecorated brown box. It was tiny, don‚Äôt think it could hold a bird. Plus there were no directions or pictures.  Wanted it for a gift for my 5 year old granddaughter but it was awful.  Sent it back immediately."
"Rapid delivery, the skull charm is much larger than I anticipated but nicely created. I wanted to add this to my Pandora bangle Halloween bracelet but it's nearly the height of my murano beads.  But overall very nice charm."
my 80 pound chocolate lab ate it in less than 5 minutes. I have bought similar products that lasted 10x longer. This is the only reason I rated 3 star as I bet my dog loved it and that's why she ate it so fast.
Excellent material and very comfortable. I ordered the xxl which fit my bottom (heavy) but very loose at the top. I will order again but in xl to see if it will balance out. I will keep the xxl and wash to shrink a little.
"This came with alot of stuff, however the best part,  the big foil letter balloons has holes in them!  Went and paid money to have them inflated,  and they didnt even keep air for more than a few hours.."
"I work in a pharmacy so ordered these to put in wedding gift bags and they‚Äôre perfect! Great value for the price for sure! I only tested the first one, but it worked just fine. Excited to give these to our guests!"
Its hard to post a review on this item because it was a gift for my nephew. I believe he liked it because he was excited when he opened it for xmas. That's about all I can say about it. Sorry.
"Good quality and love the color. I bought this for the positive message and it looks great in my classroom. It does come rolled up, so I had to lay it flat with books on top for a day or two to straighten it out"
"This is a great cleaner for getting into tight spots between rocks, wood, and plants. With the rubber airbag you can stir up  debris off the substrate and suck it out before it gets in the water column. It also works well at removing algae from delicate stem plants."
Gets the job done. Would like a dual rate for throttle as well as steering.  LEDs are BRIGHT even in direct sunlight and the glare is quite distracting; simply tape a piece of paper over the lights on the outer cover.
"Really love this dress. Better than expected.  Material is soft, print is actually beautiful. Not terribly thin, but will have to wear a slip. Fit as expected. Dress is really long for me being 5'3&#34;, would have to get it shorten, but beautiful. Would recommend!"
Broke within two days lost my keys. Got a second one from the seller same thing broke and lost the new set of keys and an ID badge that cost more money to get the badge replacement. Thought the steel cabling would be great.
"I had one like this and got a second. Mainly, I use it for the ankles/calves and wrap it around twice to hit the pressure points when my feet are burning and ache. They work wonders. Great tool to have when you need it."
"This is a challenging puzzler for even the most experienced puzzler! Fun family time piecing this together. Definitely one you will leave out and work on over a period of time. It is challenging for all. Beautiful picture once completed. Sturdy, good quality, easy to work with. Good family activity"
Purchased with high hopes of being ready for all occasions while walking our Sheltie. Lasted about a week before the light burned out ...another week till the lock broke and now is our last ditch leash. I only give this low of a review to help others when
Heard wonderful things about this harness and finally decided to try it out. It is so easy to put on and perfect for my bulldog who loves to pull when on walks. Very pleased. Great quality and super cute !!
"Very nice calendar. The bold letters and numbers are easy to see from 3 ft away, but they aren't big. I also like the bottom row of calendars for each month of this year. It's a little wider than the average size calendar but no longer."
"Product is as defined. Comes with 4 black push pins. Has 4 areas to hang it to the wall on the back - two if hanging horizontal, two if handing vertical. Corner was a little damaged both nothing you can see once hung."
"I love that you can roll the cover down to close the sandbox. Very flimsy not sturdy, And not like that it didn‚Äôt have a bottom for the sand. Had to purchase a tarp and staple it to the bottom."
"This fountain looks fine and works well, but there isn't enough room for the cats to drink without wetting their faces.  They didn't use it very much at all, so I took it away, afraid they weren't drinking enough."
"Such a beautiful set. However, I am missing an earring. This set was supposed to be a gift for a family friend but unfortunately, I need to return it. It was really pretty too. Just wish it wasn‚Äôt missing pieces"
"Just a warning - while these dice are adorable, the D20 for me is super unbalanced and consistently rolls low (bc the heaviest part of the mushroom is nestled against the 18 so that tends to be what lands on the bottom)."
"The clippers are very sharp and easy to hold and clip, I just used them and am very pleased. They also feel very durable. The set arrived in a beautiful little black box which makes it very suitable for a present, too.Great seller and quick delivery!"
"200 cards with 400 mind-provoking questions.  New couples, couples trying to conceive, and even couples with smaller children all have something to think about.  It is very useful for many life stages on the path to cohabitation, marriage, childbearing, raising children, or all of the above."
"The socks are much larger than advertised. If I were going to buy them again, which I don't think I would, I would buy a size smaller. I didn't find them comfortable even taking into account the too large size. There are better options out there for the price."
Very happy with this Extra Long Wire Pin dog slicker brush. I have three shelties with super thick coats. Regular slicker brushes just get the top hairs. This slicker brush gets right through the thick coat with no discomfort to my dogs.  Really makes their coats look great.
I am going through chemo and I use these for general pain relief and warmth. I take them right to bed and they last for hours. It‚Äôs amazing. I bought them on a whim and boy am I happy I did.
"I figured out how to use it, with the English translation documents.  This unit fits in my hand perfectly. I am new to Scenar, and am really happy to find this unit for such a great price!  Thank you Denas and Tatiana!"
This product did exactly like it was intended and stopped my back pain within 20 minutes . I like the mild sent as I don‚Äôt like smelling like menthol medicine . So this product is a good match for my needs.
In my opinion this isn't exactly a cardigan. It's very thin and the buttons on it remind me of a pajama shirt. It's okay to wear around the office when it's cool but definitely won't keep you too warm in colder climates.
Open box but everything looked good when I unpacked this along with other items I purchased. Price was perfect and would recommend this cute little Monster High critter for sure. I will post more after we are able to play with it & its no longer wrapped under our tree!
"I've only tried this on so far, but I'm impressed with the fit  I ordered XL and was afraid it would be too small but it fit nicely.  Easy care, no wrinkles.  I will amend my review if it find it doesn't wear nicely"
"Love this calendar, nice size and quality paper. My only complaint is the cute koala picture isn't on a month (it's on the first page that just has the previous years last months) - this is a huge bummer! Move them to a month during the year we can enjoy"
Good useful works fine.  Mainly used to open the couplings between O Gauge Model Rail Road Cars. (3 rail).  Sometimes there are special cars that load or unload things and this Track Section will provide the force to make them operate.
"I bought this shirt as a gift for a friend's daughter who is into Dr Who.  The shirt looks like as it does in pic, size is true-to-size, and the shirt quality is better than expected.  Would purchase agaain."
"Sheba absolutely loves this stuff (& she's worth every penny!); however, I'm afraid the price is a bit too high. The cost of this product is (in no way) equal to the amount that you receive, so I'm afraid I won't be repurchasing. SORRY!"
"Sent this back!  It doesn't look anything like the pictures.  The texture is jersey, not knit, and there is no blue in this at all.  Bummer because I really wanted what I saw in the picture.  If you do too, keep looking."
"Horrible service item in photo and description is fake actual item is 2 pieces of cloth stitched together, person buys from overseas and send it to you when you have to return item you are stuck with returning it overseas and paying the shipping price.. not even worth a star"
"This book is not too... Large, easy or difficult.  The design is well liked by my 6 yr old.  Since this was just meant as a review for summer it was perfect.  He could pick pages and completed them on his own."
"The product I received was not what was pictured. I already have a pair of the pictured glasses, but what came instead were of different design and definitely different quality. The product came in a ziplock-type bag and not in the box in the picture like it should have."
Well this is my first time using a facial set like this and its great. Its simple yet classy. The only thing is that my massage head is chipped on the side so its really wobbly but for the price it's ok. Hope it lasts for a while.
"We use this product when hand washing dishes and in a small pump bottle in the bathroom. Only takes a small amount to clean and sanitize your hands, especially after shopping and touching possibly contaminated items such and shopping carts. A LITTLE bit goes a long way."
My pup loves these treats. There also good for training. As soon as I go to her treat jar she gets so excited. She takes the treat straight to her bed and it seem likes she inhales it. I‚Äôve been purchasing this brand for over a year and no problems.
"So friggen pleased. I searched FOREVER for affordable compostable baggies in bulk because doggie/pet bags are NOT suitable enough for scooping litter. It was worth it. Hope they stay the same price!Convenient packaging. So easy to rip. Very thick bags. Generous, versatile size."
Grommet too small to fit over finishing nail - ripped completely off while trying to hang.  Paper will not accept ballpoint pen ink - must use gel roller or Sharpie. Definitely not comparable with quality of other Lang wall calendars.
"I love these masks. With COVID and all, I wanted a little more than a clothe mask since I am a bit more at risk and these are so comfy and fit very well. I have a fairly big face/head and this is just perfect."
"perfect. this is a nice quality and fits the little pup great! sturdy and made well. SHIPPING WAS FAST ENOUGH AND THEY HAVE EXCELLENT COMMUNICATION.If you found my review helpful, please click &#34;yes&#34; below where it says &#34;Was this review helpful to you?&#34;"
I bought two for my two new card tables. Bought them instead of buying mahjong mats. This way I can use for mahjong or regular card playing so it‚Äôs a win-win. High quality. Love them and so did all my friends who play cards.
"My 4yo had a saliva rash under his lower lip for nearly two months that wouldn‚Äôt go away. Pediatricians (two) recommended aquaphor and hydrocortisone cream, and neither worked to clear up his skin. The rash is gone after applying this lotion for two nights."
My girls hate it. They actually take it out of the feeder and it STAYS on the ground or floor.  Tried mixing it with their pellets or just on the ground. They still hate it. Too expensive for a chance they'll like it. Very disappointed.
I bought a cordless Milwaukee M12 soldering iron (bare tool) and found the dimensions of this case to be a perfect fit.  The mesh pocket with a velcro closure works well for storing the manual and spare soldering tips as well.
We have had this for a few months now and it has held up very well. My son really enjoys playing in it.  You don‚Äôt need to turn the water pressure up very high for it to spray into the pool.
"These are smaller than the smallest size allowed by USPS to be mailed (3.5 x 5.5""). I really wish I hadn't wasted my money for this! And now I need to order a different kind of envelope and wait for that to come before I can send out wedding invitations."
Very cute durable little sandals I have purchased them 2yrs in a row. My 4yr old loves that she can put them on herself due to the zipper in the back and they pretty much go with everything in her wardrobe.
The collar is a bit thicker than my dog‚Äôs usual collars but she tolerates it well. Very cute and big enough to show off the pattern. Sizing according to the chart fit my dog. Perfect for the holiday season. Would love to try out the other patterns as well.
"I expected better paper. And the box was crunched. The contents were unharmed and the ink cartridge works great. Wonderful pictures BUT the paper in the package is economy, very thin. If you want good paper buy the cartridge and paper separate."
I bought this product for my son as he has very bad blackheads. I used on myself and it seemed to work well. I will update when I try it on him. I‚Äôll need to prep his face to open up his pores.
"So I ordered xxl just to make sure they would fit. I‚Äôm 6,2 and oh boy are these small and tight. The quality seems good but the sizes are way off. Save your money and buy something else. I‚Äôm returning immediately."
Its very small!! I could fit an iphone but nothing else its very small! Only fits one of my products! Im very upset because the images are so misleading. Also not all of mines were black half of them were white..
"Arrived on time. This plant is beautiful, healthy and has already started roots in the gravel in my aquarium. It does not appear to be a tall species, which makes it a perfect compliment to my red star Ludwigia and my carolianas. Love the color!"
"Just received my wallet today.  Normally with small wallets I have an issue getting my ID out, but I have no problem with this wallet.  I got the purple and love the color.  Also the wallet was really packaged well."
"We don't usually bother to iron handkerchiefs.  Especially after a few washings, they're usually soft enough to fold neatly. These come out of the drier so wrinkled that it's almost impossible to fold them.  Otherwise they work okay."
"Everything came as is the table cloths were a bit small for my parks table, but just enough to cover them. The napkins came folded, but that was also fine because they were just the napkins. Really neat for its price."
Perfect for what I need! I needed a marker that wasn‚Äôt dry erase and was not permanent. My husband suggested these because he used them when he was in the military. They work great. Erase well with just a squirt of the cleaner I use.
It mounts and works but it's to wide for my scx wrangler jlu. Will not fit between the frame so shocks will not travel. I ended up stretching the front frame rails. Luck I had already removed the bumper and mounts
"Works great on those bit round bales.  I used to use my shoulder to man handle the rolls around in the barn.  With this hook, I am able to get a good grasp and pull the roll rather then push it."
"This did not work in my printer even though it said it would. I tried several times to install it, put my old cartridge back in to make sure my printer was ok and it was. It kept saying error every-time I installed this cartridge so I returned it."
"I love the look of this, but the stones are far too heavy. The clip is on like a rotating surface, so the mouse ears automatically turn upside down and aren‚Äôt as presentable. It‚Äôs always upside down because it‚Äôs too heavy"
"As my first high quality wig, I loved it, it was great for my Luka cosplay. It did tangle after wearing it but that's what you expect from long curly wigs. The color is still vibrant and the curl was beautiful (until it tangled that is.) but it's still wearable."
"My son was so excited by these, that as soon as we opened the Amazon box, he sat down on the floor and wrote out all of his thank you notes.  (It was surprising.  He's six years old.)"
The product is great except it did not come with screws as listed in the product description and as referenced in the photos of the product. Happy with how things work but disappointed I had to purchase my own screws for this.
"This is my 2nd one.  I love this thing, it's priced right, quality piece of leather, and the paper isn't bad to write on.  I keep one on my desk and one in my daily bag with a few pens."
"The sticky side didn't stick to the surface very well and kept peeling off so we had to glue it, then it didn't stick to the metal very well either and kept sliding down so I was very disappointed. We will look for a different product."
This is a cute toy however my kitty figured out how to take the flying top part off within 15 minutes.  It certainly works and is cute but they should figure on more ways to not take the top you off.
"This item is advertised for 1200 (12 packs of 100) cards and I only received 1100 (11 packs of 100). It said it was used but like new and said nothing about a pack missing. Before I return this, can we make it right?"
"Was skeptical, but ordered anyway.  The cartridges fit into my printer perfectly and no alert showed up about a non-HP device.  The color was a bit washed out but for my needs that was no problem.  Definitely worth the savings from HP extortionate prices."
This is for the passenger side only. Bought two and used one on the driver's side as well. Went on a group hiking trip so decided to use this and a different cover for the rear seats to prevent dirt and sweat on my leather. lol
Great little summer shoes...comfy and just a little dressier than regular flip flops.  I did walk about 5 miles in them the first day...was a little sore between the big and 2nd toe...but not bad considering my unexpected trek.
"What a terrible bitter taste. Not chocolate at all. Gritty and doesn't dissolve well. Not a pleasant protein powder to drink. It doesn't make me gag, and it is filling, so it gets 2 stars, but I would never ever choose this powder to purchase."
"My 6 year old pug loves this bed. I was hoping both dogs would fit and they don't,  but the other isn't a fan, so it worked out perfect. It is small, so make sure to look at the size."
"These worked great for a recent cruise. Highly recommended. Mine held up great. My boyfriend was a bit rough with his and caused it a slight tear near the ziplock closure. Despite the tear, they both lasted the length of the trip so they served their purpose."
"This is an awesome small, adjustable, swiveling, stool. Pleasantly surprised at the quality for the price. it's super useful to me, much kinder on my worn out back than bending over. Seller shipped quickly and packaged it well. Fantastic purchase."
"I purchased this charger over a year ago and it worked very well for this year.  It then ""cooked"" two 9V batteries so that the batteries actually were bent.  Then the charger stopped working.  Worked well while it lasted."
"Super easy to put together and holds a good amount of weight. It was a little hard to clean between the mesh so that's my only complaint. My dogs enjoy laying on it, so far no issues with the mesh seeming to give or the legs being wobbly."
I wanted something functional and also had a nice design look to it. This is the perfect fit. I have a medium sized dog so the bowls are the right size. The best part is it goes with the modern look of my home. Thumbs up
I wasn't sure about ordered an off-brand battery because my business depends on quality batteries. But I love this product. The batteries come in a plastic case for easy storage and retrieval. I will be ordering this again in a bigger quantity.
"I was pleasantly surprised at the sturdiness and cute styling of these glasses. I received a box of 5 cute glasses for less than the price of one pair at a local big box store. Since I am constantly misplacing glasses, these are just what I needed. Highly recommend!"
"I found this to be an exceptional product. The likeness is uncanny. It is a bit expensive, but worth the cost. I only wish that I could afford the rest of the collection. But I'm perfectly happy with Sirius Black."
"Did not come with all the parts that was advertised! It‚Äôs missing cars, a helicopter and parts that go on the truck once it‚Äôs opened up! Very disappointed! Otherwise it would have been a cool toy if all the parts would have come w it!"
Ordered the product. The only thing I would ding them on would be that the tags you write on are very hard to get out. My husband has to use tweezers to get them out. He even trimmed them as well.
i am a size c34 in bras and it fits so good and i am a little curvier on the bottom and it fits so good and not tight the material is so soft and it has patting for the bra which is good great for the price!
I use this along with the Special Pretty Bird Pellets diet for each of my parrots. They love this but . . . .I do only give it to them as a treat. A great price on Amazon . . .would repurchase again!
My favorite Shampoo! Packed to perfection!Just a perfect order! Thank you so much!!!!I love to mix one bottle of the alpha white with one bottle of the oatmeal to create the best shampoo EVER! This is the best of the best!!!!!!!!!
"This solved a problem with our HP 7500A wide-format printer.  It had begun to simply omit the yellow ink when printing - although the ink indicator status showed the yellow cartridge to be full. It works with the ""remanufactured"" ink cartridges that we had also purchased through Amazon."
"The book was fine other than it did not say ‚ÄúENVIRONMENTAL FIELD BOOK‚Äù on the cover. The one I received only said ‚ÄúENVIRONMENTAL‚Äù. It is a gift so I wanted it as advertised, not sure why it was printed differently."
Loved the unit but the motor mount bolts strip out after a day of use everything fits and looks great but the motor mount is junk and have to find a replacement of re tap them good product just be careful with the motor mounts and use locktite
"These are great, really adorable, but we only received half of the bell pair. We aren't going to return them as my daughter had already opened one of the other pairs and put them on before I told her the problem. So disappointed"
"I ordered these after reading about the &#34;Wheat Belly&#34; argument against modern wheat.  I'm not certain about all of that, but can definitely say I like these cookies - they make a satisfying dessert that is not too sweet."
I purchased this for my 5 feral cats for safety on my back deck. My husband built a nice insulated cat house to place in it plus a feeding station. It is wonderful and the cats love it! Very easy to assemble too!! Highly recommend!!
"I have not purchased this item, but was interested until I looked at the ingredients.  It includes avocados, which can cause dogs to have seizures!!! Whoever is making this stuff obviously has no idea what they're doing when it comes to dog food."
"I actually bought this set for my bunny, and he loves them! He likes to both lay in the tunnels and hop thru them. I also use them as a foraging toy for him as well. I highly recommended these for small and medium bunnies!"
I‚Äôm son has been asking for the blue lightning McQueen for a while. Our Walmart has been out of stock. Glad I purchased it here because for a few more dollars I got two extra cars! If you kid love lightning McQueen like mine does these are perfect!
"I was disappointed with my purchase. The bone was much smaller than I expected it to be after viewing it online. Also, my dog chewed it up quickly. I thought it would last a while. She chewed it up in one serving! It was not worth $6.00."
This thing is actually really sturdy and easy to assemble. My cats love it and it fit a pretty big litter box underneath. I have three cats so I have 4 litter boxes. This is a great addition to hide one of them.
"I love this leash and collar! Looks great and well made, sturdy hardware, soft squishy handle that‚Äôs very comfortable, easy to clean collar, and the leash is reflective so we can be seen when we go on our late evening walks."
Pleasantly surprised at the durability of this toy. It‚Äôs made of metal and plastic. My 6 and 3 year old sons enjoyed racing each other with this toy. What‚Äôs better for us as parents is that there‚Äôs a switch on the bottom of the toy to turn off the sound!
"This really worked out for me.  I liked the strong support with the convenience of being able to adjust the tightness.  Also liked that with a sore knee, I didn't have to struggle with trying to maneuver a tube style over my foot and up my leg."
my little 1 year old maltese got anorexia from this and refused to eat for like a week. we took her off of it and she started eating again. what helped her more is just using stainless steel bowls for her water.
I bought this for my robo dwarf hamsters but it still seeemd too small for them. The spout to floor height needs worked in. Besides the height issue I cam home to it completely spilling out of the spout and soaking all the bedding.
"My grandsons enjoy playing with it, we did not use all the little pieces(they would have them all over the houseüôÑ) I do wish I could purchase extra pieces to extend the tracks; other than that it's a good purchase."
"OMG! I love this doll! Great quality. Edgar Allen Poe is soft and cuddly! Who knew? He's designed with a flat butt, so he can sit on a shelp with his legs dangling and won't slide off. Perfect for the lover of all think Poe."
They are ok but if you try to put it on a thicker cable you will regret it. I tried to fix a x maxx and the cables just won‚Äôt fit inside. They will work on small cables like the slash though.
Adorable toothbrushes. I love that they‚Äôre non-toxic for my toddler & he loves the little animals on each brush. Had an issue with something and the company offered really great customer service. Highly impressed! There‚Äôs no pride and service like that of a small business!
I get a lot of Compliments when I wear this cape sweater.  Looks very stylish paired with boots. Plus you can wear your butterfly arm bounces under it for the winter when your regular coat does not work. Just wear a pair of gloves and scarf.
Thought it would work for me. Itdoes not. Pages get caught does not hold book properly. I can only use my left hand and thought this would be a good thing fornme. It is not. So I spent two hundred dollars for somethingni cannot use.
Child weighs 110 and it is just right for them.  Have smaller one and whale but both require an adult or partner to hold the rider on.  Big kids can ride this with no problem.  Will probably order another soon.No dislikes so far.
Good price for the pair but won't last a week with normal use.  My youngest had it in her shoes for a week and by the end of the week it was just wrecked.  Very low quality and not durable at all.
I got this for my stepmom and she said it was really nice. The cat doesn't make a lot of mess but he does make little paw prints on the floor. This helped a lot with capturing the liter that would fall when he was done with his business.
I know it says that these are for ages 3 and up but we got these for my one year old son and he loves them! Great for car rides or anywhere we need him to be still. Good quality and lots of fun.
"I was a bit dubious about the thickening part, but as it turns out, it works! A small amount yields lots of suds, and the fact that it's free of so many chemicals used in regular shampoos makes it even better!"
This money box is a lot lighter than my past money box. I love that it has the separate money compartments which makes it easy to give change. I have this for vendor events and it is a great thing to have!! Even has a compartment below for extra items
The Dawdler Dudes dog toy line is my dog's favorite toy to play with.  She likes all of the Dawdler Dudes toys.  She likes to shake them and make them squeak.  She plays with them every day.
I love this thing! I let the suction cups soak in hot water (in a tub) as instructed and they work! I had to move it several times for better placement and that also seemed to help ‚Äúbreak in‚Äù the suction cups too.
Looks great adds good weight.  Fits perfect.  The original screws work the best.  This is a competition crawler.  Keeping the budget low.  I been destroying competition since purchaced.  Still haven touched the gears motor or esc. I run 3s now
Staunch Huperzine-A is hands down one of my favorite supplements! I take it daily and I definitely feel a difference in my overall brain function. You get 120 servings for only $15. You definitely get your money‚Äôs worth. I recommend it to everyone!
Got this for guinea pig pellets. (Our GPs were always flipping their bowl over.) Worked great at first and then they figured out how to pop it out and they are back to flipping it over. Just wish it would lock in place somehow.
"This product has everything I needed in one. I‚Äôve been having a cough and chest congestion for about a week. I had to take 1 every four hours for 3 days, but It cleared it up and I have energy now. Thanks so much! Answer to prays. Von Daniels"
My mother has Alzheimer‚Äôs and talks for several hours before falling asleep. This bed alarm has allowed us to sleep in the next room and get rest. We place the pad under her shoulders so we know when she starts to get up from bed.
Loved the look of the boot however as soon as I took them out of the box to try them on the Velcro covering on the zipper tore off and the zipper was broke.  Sent them back the same day.
Would be a perfect product if laminated but for the price you are getting high quality material. Would suggest keeping them high up as younger toddlers would likely tear them apart (hence the need for lamination). Letters are big and coloring is nice.
"Very cute bag, unfortunately the stitching in the straps were torn in a few places, affordable and good sized because I carry my wallet, 2 phones and whatever else my 1 year old might need for the outing but too disappointed in the straps. Returning."
"These are excellent notepads.  Longer than the standard steno pads, with extra lines for notes.  I like the spiral ring at the top .. it doesn't get in the way as you are writing.  Clear covers, each page is the same front and back."
"Excellent anti-glare/eye strain protection due to the tint. Very comfortable to wear and important for me, the rims are unobtrusive. I spend most of my day looking at a computer screen of some description. These relieve a lot of stress during the day."
Love this ring.  I love the modern take on a classic ring look with the opal bead.  I wear it in my daith and get compliments all the time.  Did not break me out or turn me green!
"Bought this as a birthday present for my hedgehog-obsessed daughter and she had it for a total of four hours before the shaft broke at the handle. For $23, one would think it would at least last a few months."
Way too big for a small animal. I should have looked at the size of the cone instead of relying on the advertisement and Amazons search engine. It would cost more to send it back so will be donating it to the Humane Society
"Like others said, there is no mounting hardware, but I liked the design so I ordered anyway.  My husband sunk a couple screws in the middle up against the back wiring where it would be hidden if papers were in the bin."
"i am 5'5 and wear a 16 - this sweater was too long, the sleeves went past my hands and the pockets were too low to reach comfortably. but i liked the feel of the sweater , even though it had ""plastic"" smell."
I have several pens that I rotate between but this is one of the best by far.  It feels great and writes smoothly.  The grip is fantastic to the point that hands don't get tied like they do with the metal or knurled grips.
"This thing is perfect for my foster kittens! One of the shelves was a little broken, but my husband was able to fix it. The seller offered to send a replacement, but we made it work. It‚Äôs great because they can go vertical. Love, love this!!!"
"Buddy usually prefers the floor, but when we got this bed, he took to it right away.  He loves to curl up in it, especially on cold nights.  He is a 50 # labradoodle and it fits him perfectly."
It is ok I guess - but I thought it was inches... it was cm - super tiny! About 3 inches high! I wanted something for fish to swim through... somewhat deceptive IMO - they should put a coin in the PIC so you can see how small it is.
"At current special times, the face mask is very helpful.The mask feels silk-like, very cool for summer. The bottom is long, ideal to cover the neck. I like the blue color, exactly as the photo shows.Lovely features:a) long, covering the neck. b) thin and silk-like feeling. c) Pretty blue color."
"The only thing this did was melt my mascara and deposit it on my upper lid.The real insult was that it left my (now naked) lashes completely straight. (FYI:The directions suggest putting on an initial coat of mascara before using.)Also, needs to be charged before each use."
"Hmmm‚Ä¶It just doesn‚Äôt work!! I used on a 3 gal tank ( it‚Äôs rated for 5 gals),  indoors with my AC set at 70 F.  Don‚Äôt waste  your money or time, I don‚Äôt get how others reviewed this thing so high. Mine is going back."
"The material is thick, not light. It has a heavy cloth feel and it is very stretchy that turns into bagginess and out-stretched. I wore and washed once and it's just not comfy for summer. I could go a size down."
[[VIDEOID:2d63ed37ff1271f0e205a926b6057367]] Another great RC from Haiboxing! It is very stable and durable. It has 2 speed modes so it is perfect for someone new to driving an RC. Even experienced hobbiests will find fun in it for what it is. This makes a perfect gift.
"You can see the color the filter gets and what it picks up. So it works and it‚Äôs super easy to switch. We love this fountain for our cat. Probably would work for a small dog too, but wouldn‚Äôt work for a medium to big dog. It‚Äôs too small."
"It‚Äôs such a very cute pencil case with an amazing space inside that could handle my calculator and a lot of my pencil, ruler, erasers, stapler‚Ä¶ I love the small pocket in the front, which could fit my AirPods and other small stuffs. Definitely love it and recommend üòçüòçü§ó"
The only problem is that should have been manufactured in a greater length so as to allow greater flexibility in the ability to use on glasses with longer length at thesame time being able to cut shorter for frames that requires short ones.
I‚Äôm a woman and I use it as a purse for everything. It‚Äôs great to be able to turn it into a clutch on some days and use the long strap for other days. Great Purchase. The Brown color goes with everything.
Top of the boot is snugger than i would have liked.  Makes wearing any sort of pant other than skinny jeans or leggings difficult as there's no room to push down extra fabric.  But the design is so cute and unique I'm keeping them anyway.
Bought as Christmas gift for my daughters who both love the Hunger Games.  While they were larger than I had expected the kids love them.  My nine year old has not taken it off since she got it.
"Not a fan.  They don't have a surface that will buff out discoloration caused by nail polish and even the nail file side is too soft to effectively file/shape nails.  They are good for about 1 use each. They produce some shine, bit definitely not a lot."
Should have listened to others reviews. Started leaking almost immediately after using for the FIRST time. And of course by the time I found out (was bought as a gift) I was 2 days past the return period. So irritated!!!! üò°üò°üò°
Love it. Except for the ugly charm. Cut it off and it works great. Be warned it doesn't have a &#34;leash&#34; loop. Which is fine. Because I would never walk my dog without a harness. She is 2lbs. And the xs works great with holes on both sides to adjust.
"This cart has a design that if you have an imagination, allows you to trim the length of the tubes that provides for different shelf heights which I took advantage of.  The overall quality of the cart is far better than most others that I considered"
"The squeakers make nice noice and have an easy shape to stuff the toys but the squeaker part gets out of it easily if your dog plays and bites the toy frequently, and Jack Russells can play rough!Since they are cheap, I just replace them when they stop squeaking!üôÇ"
I LOVE this toner spray. I use it after face wash every morning right before moisturizer. There isn't much of a tingle but I can definitely feel my pores tightening. This spray doesn't leave my skin too dry and it's definitely gentle enough to use every day.
This is a solidly built and very attractive desk tray.  The wood looks deep and rich; it will enhance your desk area.  The overall design works well ... it's properly sized for good capacity and easy access.  Good price too.  Get one!
My son needed a red belt for summer camp so I bought this one.  It worked perfectly and best of all my son actually wore it (he hates belts) for the entire camp.  The material can be cut to size as it was quite long.  Recommend.
"[[VIDEOID:489936f3e88d2b0f36a67f75e0204654]] This is a above avg filter for up to 50 gal tank, for the value it's very good. Skim cleaned tank very quickly but more importantly it is pretty quiet ü§´ instalation took around 10 mins to setup and I would definitely recommend."
"Bought 2 of these on nov 18th it only lasted 3 months!.!. I have it turning on twice A-day for one minute each time it turns on, 3 sprayers on level 5 pressure. 1 out of 2 working for 3 months... I guess is okay in today's world???"
My cat sits on the roof to chill after he comes in for breakfast every morning.  He likes to sit and watch us. It is his exclusive place that he would not let his brother sit. So I can only tell about him.
"I hang this inside my kitchen cabinet and make notes on it.  It is beautiful and perfect for my needs. I look for the exxact same calendar every year, and HAPPY when I am able to find it.  It was priced correctly and shipped quickly."
"I was looking for natural ways to reduce my cholesterol levels and I found this product. I was worried I would have side effects, but so far so good. No side effects at all and my levels have lowered some points already."
"Over all great. The see thru color however became and issue for me, as my chameleon would launch its tongue from the bottom since she could see the food moving in there from underneath. I was scared she would injur herself."
"These are sturdy and will do the work we need done, but we color-code files in the office and these are BROWN, not red. They're not even brick-like in color. Brown. Really. Brown. If we hadn't been in immediate need, would have returned these."
"I'm unsure what Treezyn is considering a late season. Here in upstate NY 30 degrees or colder while hunting, these gloves and their hats do not cut it.  Make them thicker as well as your late season gator, it's too tight small and not warm at all."
My husky loves it!  She sings super loud for it each time.  The treats are a nice size and can easily be broken into smaller pieces.  They are also light in weight and don't have any intense scents that will linger on your fingers.
"I really should have looked closely at the dimensions.  This is no bigger than an adult thumb.  For the price, I really did not even expect to receive something so small.  Yes, my error, but the photo is very misleading.  This will be going back."
"As an &#34;almost Boomer&#34; who is discovering some not so pleasant things (like you can't write as small as you once did), this was just the ticket.  It would have been nice if it came in different colors, but I was glad to find one usable."
"I bought this black velvet dress in the extra small size and think it‚Äôs absolutely so beautiful and elegant looking, very soft and velvety. The extra small size is perfect for a petite frame, and it is true to size. Five stars"
Ordered for my husband's desk....fits perfectly for his small desktop computer and mouse!!  He is very happy and that makes me happy!!  Good quality as well.  Would suggest this desk top pad to anyone in need of a replacement or a new one.
I‚Äôd give this no stars. It doesn‚Äôt work at all my dogs have literally barked right next to this and it doesn‚Äôt affect them in the slightest . I don‚Äôt know why there are so many positive reviews. Will be returning.
"I've wanted one of these for sometime now. My friend recommended this brand because its lightweight, quiet and effective. I must say I love it because the Nimbl works fast on contact to alleviate those aches and pains. Its worth every penny."
"Child tired of the toy within minutes and never regained interest, even after a year.  Cat barely moves when it walks, we have carpet, vinyl and wood floors.  Maybe if your child is allergic to animals this is something to consider."
"These were a little more cheaply made than I expected and were rather unceremoniously stuffed into a ratty plastic bag.  Not a nice presentation at all.  They're ok (I bought three, different designs) but nothing special.  I probably wouldn't get them again."
"The feather didn't make for a very good pen, but I had another hanging around somewhere. The ink is very lovely and I've had it for a very long time. Don't know if I'll need to replace it for a long time."
This is by far the worst dog jumper suit I have bought my do.  Took forever to put on him.  It‚Äôs really thin and provides no warmth from the elements. I returned this just as quick as I got it.
"The best thing we have come across for traveling with a dog! We used it for camping and it was great! Super easy to have bowls, 2 things for food storage, a mat, and a scoop that all fit in one bag."
"These clippers work so well, they cut my grooming time in half!! They're quiet and come with guards that are easy to change and provide great versatility.  Not having a cord to fight with is a huge help too!"
"These are what they are. I have had no problems with them. I appreciate that they're pre-sharpened. Great for music students to mark their music. Not sure why they came with pencil sharpeners; if I wanted one, I could buy it separately. I did not need these."
my parents always use to use this rubbing alcohol is like a miracle medicine but i dont know why they dont sell them in stores anymore i dont know if it has something to do with covid 19 but i find them pretty expensive on amazon.
GUESS THAT IS WHAT IT WAS & (3 SM. EARS OF CORN)..MY MALTESE LIKED THE CORN & CELERY IF I BROKE IT UP..BUT HARD TO DO THAT AS IT WAS LIKE A TIRE...PIC. SHOWS CARROTS..BUT WAS NO CARROTS IN BAG I REC'D...BUT HE DID EAT WHAT I GOT...
Very easy to use. Very comfortable. Provides relief from pain due to slouching which most everyone does. This really helps at first we were doubtful but after using for a while it shows. My posture is way better and my back doesnt hurt as much
"My skin is super soft thanks to this thing. Way better than the kalux clothes. My brown skin is radiant and super soft to the touch. It lathers well and isn't painful against my skin. Super long too, so you can reach your back with ease. 5 stars!"
"One bead fell off days after I received them. I managed to reattach, but they both got discolored over a few months (definitely not real rose gold). The posts are also crazy long. These are in the trash now, don't waste your $$"
"Didn't even pick it up. Had this for a pre-order a long time ago for a Christmas gift... And oddly few days before delivery, the photo shows a cheap stuffed animal. They can keep it....  Let me guess it's from China"
"I was making medal boards for our Cross Country team and needed the flat 6""X4"" picture holders so I could adhere them to the board. They were perfect. The double-sided adhesive mounts were surprisingly stronger than what I was expecting. Very happy."
My 2 kittens seem to love the toys so far. I should've paid better attention to the description.  You get 24 of the springs and only 6 of the mesh toys. My kittens prefer the mesh toys. So a bit disappointed but they seem to be good quality.
"I purchased this Gundam action figure as a Valentine's gift for my lovely wife Bessie.  It's a snazzy Gundam thing and my enclosed message of ""A Gundam angel for MY angel"" should win Ol' Hops many points and another wifeless night out on the town.  Love rules!!!"
"I am using these to store WIP's for my needlepoint. They are incredibly sturdy and made very well, and will no doubt hold up to the abuse of using them over and over.  Wish I had found these years earlier!"
"This material is simply too light for the attractive style. The shaping is good, but it's a bit big and so not attractive.I'm 5'4"" and 163lb - could have sized down. Not sure I'll ever wear. Cannot return as I live on an island.  Pity."
"Cartridges were compatible thank goodness!  But it took awhile and re-installation and hitting the cartridge face down (ink sides) on a piece of paper to get the ink flowing for it to work.  Now it works.  Thank you, speedy shipment."
"My daughter and I were very disappointed in the quality of this costume. Not realistic whatsoever, and extremely overpriced. The cape was also missing a button to be able to attach to wear it around her neck. We were so sad because we love Sarah Sanderson! Would not recommend this."
Very cute.  Sturdy enough to use on marshmallow pops and rice crispy years.  My only complaint is that it's a random selection so we had way more of some designs.  Only one pack of my favorite design.
My cats generally like these bowls except they slide around a bit too easily within the stand with enthusiastic eaters and startle the cats. If the wood had a silicone grip where the bowls sit in the stand to hold them steady it would be 5 stars.
"What is this?!? I ordered small and this thing is huge. Forget fitting my 10 lb dogs, it is even too big for my pit bull. It says small. I have the same one without the fleece in a small and the sizes are completely off!!"
"Got theses todayWith all the negative reviews I wasn't sure, but I got them anyway, glad I did , they are perfect for what I need them for pictures fit great and look good!  They came in great shape , none broken and will order more soon."
"Helps but doesn‚Äôt remove the odor entirely especially if the dog has been directly sprayed.  My dog got sprayed in the face, I‚Äôve washed him multiple times but can still smell skunk especially when he‚Äôs been running or gets wet."
This hoodie is awesome. I ordered an XL and it fits perfect. I like the material. Good quality. I always have people asking me where I got it. My wife said that it is hers now and that I got jacked!
"Needed some more ‚Äúenvelopes‚Äù as I sell online some.  Ran across these with lovely floral print.  They do seem lightweight, but I haven‚Äôt had any buyer complain that they‚Äôve had any issues.  (I package tops in these) they seal up great and look nice! Recommend! :)"
I need one from the top of the cage to the bottom. I have canaries and finches and both of them make one big mess. I have been keeping them inside because of the chilly nights and so many are sitting on eggs. This helps some.
This product did literally nothing for my dog. The scent is completely watered down. I have purchased this exact brand and scent from a department store and this is not what I expected. I want a full refund on this products
"Holds my Glucose Tablets perfectly.  My keys are around me most of the day. Now I have access to my emergency tabs... Yes it is pricey, but I will have this the rest of life.. Im very happy with the purchase."
"I have using for many years now Canary Seed for human comsumption ...  use it as Cannary Milk ....  This people deliver fast, good price in the market and the real thing ... thank you Guys and happy holydays."
The lining on the top is thick enough that you can wear it without a bra but the overall fabric is so light and breathable it is perfect to wear on a hot day. The dress is very flattering which is nice since I have a bigger frame.
"These only worked mildly on my dog without anxiety issues. For my dog who does have anxiety issues, they did not help at all. If your dog doesn't have anxiety issues, these would probably work just fine. The dogs seem to enjoy the taste."
My 7 year old daughter has been using this as a reading chair when she isn‚Äôt using it in the pool and it has been great! It has been abused and is still inflated from the first time I inflated it.
I really like Method products. I love the scent of this but it takes a lot more pumps to get my clothes clean and to actually smell like the scent. Maybe I will try another scent and see if its any better.
"I LOVE THE NATY DIAPERS! They keep our sons dry better than seventh generation, and are environmentally conscious and clean (read the ingredient list on your diapers and realize things go both ways through the skin).We pair these with the Water Wipes, and are very happy with the duo!"
I use this with my Phillips Dreamwear. It slips in line with the hose connection. It requires some bit of effort to disconnect and reconnect nightly. This can be remedied by applying a bit of olive oil on the connection.
"This is just what I was looking for to carry my midday pills to work with me! It easily fits 7 large tablets so I can keep track of my doses for the week. It's better to have on my office than a very conspicuous, ugly pill bottle."
It was well made...just way too heavy and bulky.I ended up giving it to my brother who RE_GIFTED it ...you guessed it BACK to ME...I think you should display this watch in the BOATING DEPARTMENT...it would make a fine anchor since its water tight to 3 inches.
I love these rings! I bought one for each finger on both hands. As far as I can tell the workmanship is just fine for the price I think these are awesome rings. To be clear I own two of these not eight of these. LOL
"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. I love it. She has so much fun playing with this. The accessories seem fairly durable. The little watch works, as does the cooker, and lantern. They take AA batteries. It‚Äôs really cute and I‚Äôm glad I got it."
Bought for Quacks of Quedlinburg. Worked well for all of the potion chips but there are several burrs on the outer edges of the coin capsules and there were several damaged. But overall a good price for what we got.
"For hard core Lego fans who enjoy mythology and games! My 8 year old son loved the process, putting game together, playing it and changing the rules. Warning: super tiny pieces - be sure to have lots of small containers ready to hold pieces while you are putting it together."
&#34;Exfoliating&#34;? The scrub pad is far too smooth for a satisfying scrub and I can hear stitching ripping as I attempt to &#34;exfoliate&#34; - give this another week or so before dissolution. The size/length of the scrubber is perfect however.
"Very low quality design, I‚Äôm not sure how well this will hold up. Be very careful putting the door on as it will push the two sides apart since they‚Äôre not mechanically joined. I may super glue this to keep it together.Update: this broke after one day of light use"
"These gloves are wonderful and beyond my expectation. The price is not expensive, the quality is good and the color is beautiful. They are thick and still strong. It is easy to use and fits well with my hands. Great product!"
I bought this as a welcome back sign for my daughter when I first purchased it it worked then after second time turning it on it didn‚Äôt. I got a replacement got it ASAP I was surprised! Works perfectly thank you I love it!
I didn't received the item I ordered.  These show the smooth bottom and rounded square corners.  I received the raised pressed bottom and sharp square corners.  I was needing these to go with another plate and was very disappointed when they were not as listed.
"I have been using these for weekly church offerings, ever since my church stopped providing boxes of envelopes due to a budget crunch several years ago.  The envelope fits in my pocket next to a cellphone, very nicely.  It can be laser-printed."
"This was a fun puzzle to put together - on the more difficult side ue to the colors and arrangement - but I really enjoyed it.  The pieces are a good size & thickness, and the fit is snug."
"My dog use to lay down to eat. I‚Äôm guessing that that her food was too low on the floor. After I got the feeder stands, she can eat comfortably now and she doesn‚Äôt have to lay down to eat."
"These socks were for my 16 month old daughter. They're great. She can't rip them off and throw them at us. She actually leaves them on. They're cute and we don't have to hear crap about the &#34;barefoot baby&#34; and her &#34;feet being cold&#34; from well-meaning, snide, busy-body, sanctimommies."
"I ordered two of these with high hopes, but they arrived in a very small box rolled up quite tight. They are so flat and have no give to them- there‚Äôs now way they would be more comfortable than the floor."
"Very disappointed in these stickers. The pictures are adorable. Perfect size as I use them on all my birthday cards.When I tried to pull the first one off instead of the adhesive back, it ripped the paper off. I had to try three other stickers before one came off intact."
When I went to put ink cartridge in my printer it did not recognize the cartridge.  I had to go to Walmart and buy a canon ink cartridge and it worked.  Don't waste your time buying these. Sometimes cheap is not better.
"It is a little awkward fit and it's a bit too short, very lightweight sheer material.  I just need it to wear under my blazer so it's fine for that purpose but I wouldn't wear it to work without a cami underneath."
My son has ASD and is very detail oriented. He is currently in love wirh dinosaurs. Being able to find some of the more obscure species has been very exciting for bith of us snd made him beyond happy! This manufacturer is both well made and nicely detailed.
"This powder is great.....it is much stronger than other black powders that have used. There was no need to mix it with a regular white to achieve the desired strength and it is a very deep, dark black.  No broken nails in 2 weeks."
"I liked these ink cartridges and will order again when I need some more.I am so glad I found these and they fit my printer and are easy for me to install them and replace another cartridge.Thank you so much for a great product,Beverly Watterson."
Love this little coat and the dog does too. The snap on hood is great because he only needs it in the rain.  So the Velcro ties around the belly and neck are perfect. Easy on and easy off.
"It was so thick and hard to get out, my hands ached from trying to squeeze it out. I even made the hole bigger, but that didn't help. If you have any kind of arthritis or rheumatism in your hands, this is not the glue for you."
"Opened package day of delivery and inside was a melted solid mass. No holes, no pockets. I broke off a piece to see how my dog felt about flavor amd for the first time in ten years she spit something out. Maybe the texture was the issue."
"This product is terrible, it is SO cheap, I will have to order another DIFFERENT one in the near future...It is cheaply made and also is difficult to lock, when locked, it is difficult to unlock. overall, don't waste your money on this product!"
"I would. have given it 4 1/2 stars because with the part where u connect the three swords to the body it is a tiny bit loose. But, you can put a bit of super glue on the connector then it becomes perfect!"
Rolls kinda slow even when fully charged. It does not go well on thin carpeting at all.. you need tile or wood floors only.. cats lost interest on day 2.. they watched it on day 3 but no longer care to chase it or look for it.
"This is not a small like the one pictured above, this is a large. Very disappointed, product was severely scratched up, and one piece broke as I was trying it on.. Arrived in a fake CB-6000 box, not even a fake CB-6000s box."
I was very happy with the quality of the print from this toner cartridge.  Large black areas in images were solid black.  Other cartridges that I have tried left small blank spots that were annoying.  I will definitely buy this brand again.
"I love this product. I also bought chalk markers to write on it with, and it wipes off very easily with out leaving residue behind. 10/10. It is also the perfect size, and I love that it can be hung on the wall. Great for leaving messages!"
"These stretch ok, but we're much shorter than expected. The description said bamboo, but are cotton, instead. They do have the silicone at the heel, to help sock stay on, though. They came from China so it's probably too expensive to return, or I would."
"Sweet, very reasonably priced piece, given to a friend in winter months.  Looks lovely against a dark color.  Well made, presented in a small green pouch which is good for storing.  Size and color spot on in web photo.  Very pleased with this purchase!"
"I think this is a pretty good food; the ingredients are bad & I like that it is formulated for a specific breed; with that being said, I don't think its necessary at all to do this, but it did have some added benefits such as glucosamine."
My grandkids love these!!! They are so cute fun to have repeat what you say to them in a fast and funny voice. We have had several of these and we try to get them to have a conversation with each other lol the grown-ups have just as much fun
"This product is great!,  gives me a tremendous pump that lasts. Next day I'm sore/pumped all day long feels outstanding, only one thing : had to find out when to take before my workouts(I take it about an hour and a half before my workouts)"
Unfortunately didn't really work for me--had to go with the Tuli gel cup to really relieve the pain in my heel due to losing some of the fat padding in the heel.  Might be useful for some with lesser issues.
"This is really poorly made. The front and back are just hard cardboard covered in thin plastic. The snap is weird and awkward. The plastic is so thin, I have doubts that this would last even a few months, much less a whole school year. It's really disappointing."
"I ordered this intending to use it as a clutch.  Since it is flat, there's not room for much, but I can put my iPhone (which is one of the larger versions) on one side and license, cash, and credit cards in the other side.  Just right!"
"This shirt is super cute. The orange is richer in person, a little more of a pumpkin orange than a summery orange, but I actually prefer the richer shade. It fits as expected and is a thick enough material that I expect it to hold up well."
I have used several types of brushes and combs on my Dutch bun. They just barely touched the surface of my bunnies fur. This comb is amazing! And my bun loved it too. He didn't want me to stop combing him. I highly recommend for bunnies.
"Color has faded a bit because of everyday use, but part of the product is white in color and sees extensive wear, and that is something I expected. Excellent quality material, and minimal wear and tear over the material itself."
"Very impressed with the quality of this collar, it's stitching is very durable and thick..the neoprene padding is another plus. the buckle is also of great quality..i know this collar will last quite some time.. my dog isnt botherd by it at all."
"The inside silicon fingers do their job well enough, but I‚Äôm disappointed with how easily the top comes off. I doesn‚Äôt stay on at all while I‚Äôm using it on my dogs paws, which makes the whole process a little messier."
I bought these for a friend as a gift.  They arrived very quickly and were packed nice.  She said they worked very well and she loved the different speeds you could set them on.  She was very satisfied.
"The mask pictured is NOT what you get. The one pictured is like the hard plastic ones but this is a crappy rubber mask. My daughter got it with her bday money and wish she had let me read it first. This company is just falsely advertising, stay away."
"Cat loves these because of the rattle. A little cheaply made and somewhat concerned with coloring. However, my cat kills her mice by drowning them in her water dish and no bleeding of color. Hmmmm. Also great quantity as they get lost under sofa, would buy again."
"Pros.Every piece really easy to put together and display, and the price couldn't be better.The amount of weapons this comes with is the value itself. Mixes well with my other figures.Cons.When mixing with other set, the strain on this version hands can be a bit much. So be careful."
"So after having 2 kids natural vaginal, these balls are a little too small. Maybe as my pelvic floor conditions they will be more useful. Very pretty, nice little bag they come in and the natural stone feels very good."
"I'm pleased with the fact that it's such a feminine, pretty product. The paste comes in a gel form, not overly sweet but I wish it were even less sweet than as is. I'm happy enough to purchase it again."
"It‚Äôs cute don‚Äôt get me wrong, but if it hadn‚Äôt been on sale in the single digits I wouldn‚Äôt have bought. My kids saw it and thought it was cute. The pony tail is very heavy and keeps pulling it"
"They are what they are advertised to be!I love these because you can cover them with fabric, paint them, make push pin symbol designs, use as memo boards or for pictures, you can cut them into smaller pieces and get creative...the possibilities are endless!"
"The bear seemed  cute at first, but now as I look at him in the box he likes kind of cheap. (and the bear looks like he is starting to tarnish as well.)  I feel guilty giving it to anyone at Christmas."
I tried all the fun toothbrushes and still my munchkin hated teeth brushing time‚Ä¶. Untill I found this tooth brush! She loves it! It‚Äôs easy to use really cleans the teeth and she thinks it‚Äôs so fun! Do yourselves a favor parents and get this for your munchkins!
Bought as a gift for my niece. She LOVES it!!! The wings and top come off and can go onto different barbies. She couldn't wait to get it home and give her favorite barbie the fairy wings from this one.
Extra top came broken.  I didn't really need it so I didn't worry about it.  But now two of the containers have broken at the screw top part.  I travel a lot and need something more reliable so I won't be reordering these.
"Not quite what I expected. It doesn't foam or lather very well. The brush bristles feel like they're doing a little bit of exfoliation, but it's not the product to get the same type of lathering you'd get from a loofah."
I got this groomer because my cat started eating the bristle and got sick on her other arched groomer. It is perfect except it didn‚Äôt attract her. I even put cat nip on it. It should be the perfect groomer if cats just give it a chance.
"If your dog loves squeeky toys, and you remember and like Mr. Magoo, this is a hoot.  It is holding up well to an active chewer and sounds off every time.  If you are not a squeeky toy fan, pass on this one."
I am happy with the pen but it came damaged because they packed it in a box with a set of shoes and now it says I can‚Äôt return or replace it but that isn‚Äôt what the page said. This is B/S
I would order thicker ones if they were available. If not I would orders somewhere else.  These worked ok but not as sturdy as I would need.  Packaging was fine and they came in good shape.  My fault that I didn't check thickness better.
"This was so satisfying to put together. Really love it. Just be careful when working with the more delicate pieces.  Also, pay attention to the directions, pieces need to be put together a certain way or it won't work."
I liked the color but many had holes in them and they had a horrible smell. After blowing up 4 balloons my lips started tingling and I had an allergic reaction! I‚Äôm not sure what powder was on them but I am not allergic to latex.
"This is so beautiful made, I'm so in love with everything about it the material is soft and comfortable it doesnt need a undershirt at all it stands up on it's own and is very full I'm super happy with it.‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
Great granddaughter loves CoComelon and has developed an interest in being a doctor so this gift was the perfect combination for a Christmas gift. She loves it and plays with it all the time.  Was her fav gift this year. Success!
The plastic rider figurines could be a little more durable but the dirt bike are great!  Most played with Christmas present by my 3 and 4 year old for sure!  And they can even get their 11 year old brother to play with them!
The jumpsuit fit just fine but the shirt that comes with it was so small. It was like for a girl in training bras. If you have a d cup or more idk. I ordered extra large n thought my extra large boobs would fit... lol oh well.
"It's super cute, and complete with the frame. My kids loved it and it hung up on the wall quick and easy when they were done.I did have to help a little with it but it was their first time making these."
I‚Äôm not in love with this dress. It‚Äôs cute and I wanted to love it.  I kept it but didn‚Äôt wear it. I wear a size 14. I have broad shoulders and a 2xl fits me. Maybe I‚Äôll wear it. Call me wish-washy!
What better way than to support you team while trying to be a safe member of the Bills Mafia.  Love my ring and will wear it until I need a new one or my wife gets fed up with my love of all things Buffalo Bills!
Clothes are well made. The shorts are too wide for the My Life As Dolls boy dolls. They cannot stay up. The shorts fit the My Life As Dolls girl dolls and look very nice on them. We are happy with our purchase.
"I got a medium, and it was very baggy. Didn't mind the extra room but it looked saggy on me. If I got a size smaller, it might have shown my underwear lines. I don't like to wear pantyhose since it's hot weather where I live."
My daughter love these. This is the second time I am purchasing them. She wears them daily and lasts about 8 months. Not bad at all! The no tie feature is great! Highly recommend for children who need close toe shoes for school.
"My cat loves these and knocks them around all over! He loves the sound on the floor, but it's the only drawback for me: If I'm concentrating asleep his whines when he can't retrieve it from behind a closed door the sound is annoying ;-)"
"These are feathers glued onto cardboard,  basically.  The feathers were a bit crushed and didn't look like the picture. I ended up returning them and getting the less expensive ones ($15.99) from Party City, which were much nicer."
"I needed replacement batteries for the emergency lights in our church.  These were priced right and are perfect in every way.  The lights all work when the power is off, which is what I needed the batteries to do.  Very satisfied."
I love this shirt and the skirt! I wore them together and tucked the top in which made it look more like a dress. The pearls are held on by a metal piece making them very very sturdy. This shirt was not see through either!
"I just received this book and it is in Pristine condition.  All the pages were there, no rips. Its on my book case in my collection. It had a beautiful note from the seller. Very happy with this transaction and this seller. Would Definitely buy again."
The pictures does no justice to how this watch band actually looks.. I love it and am planning on getting them in all colors.. The light sparkles off the diamonds and makes it look even better... Nice and comfortable as well...
It's not contoured like the image would have you believe. It is still rounded like a normal badge holder. I didn't return because it was cheap enough and I snipped off the back half to make it slimmer so it didn't feel so bulky under my shirt.
"I received my watch a couple weeks ago. The pictures do this watch no justice. You must, I repeat you must see this dial in person. The fit is very comfortable. This is the best red dial of 2021/2022. It will stand out when worn with any suit color."
"I have had one of these for 3 weeks now and it has only worked for 4 days.  Contant troubles with it connecting, not being set up, won't consistantly pair with my phone.  I've spent more time messing with this than it's worth."
Well made and has lots of things and textures for kids to do and feel! I‚Äôm excited to give it to my daughter. We are saving it for a LONG car ride in a couple weeks! Really hoping it keeps her entertained for awhile!
"When I inserted the 92 cartridge (tried both of them), my printer detected it as a 98, ruling it incompatible.  My printer doesn't offer the option to &#34;ignore&#34;/bypass the error (as the instructions advise to do).  Unable to use the black."
Every cat owner needs one of these. Not only is it dispensing water but it‚Äôs purifying the water so it can be safer for your cat. Saves lots of time instead of refilling up bowl you fill this once for 2 weeks. My cat loves this!
"Its a cute idea but the spoon is always bent. It would be better if it &#34;clicked&#34; straight and then with pressure it bent. The way it is now, if you put it in a bowl, its bent right away and obvious."
"Love this!!!  We have been using it for two summers now and absolutely love it.  Instead of using the middle cooler for drinks, sometimes we put our dog (Wheaton Terrier) in there and she sits and floats with us!!"
This is the only treat my Bengal will eat!  He comes RUNNING when you shake the bag!  He turns his nose up at everything else.  They are small enough for training treats and are easy to break into smaller pieces.
"I love it!  It does exactly what it is supposed to do, and much more.  Massage, cools, even numbs if needed.  It can be cleaned after and between people, because the material is hard plastic.  Great product."
"These are not removable--they're stuck to my white board and I can't get them off. They do not erase well. Expo spray has to be used each time you want to erase, and even that doesn't get them completely clean."
"PERFECT! Super sturdy, two great tops t choose as it is double sided. The table is heavy but not so much that I cannot move it (I am only 5'2&#34;) with great surface space. I would definitely make a purchase again if I need an additional table."
"I like this printer.  The Canon inks are excellent and produce lovely photos, but they are way too expensive - $50 without black included!  I am on a serach for other ink products that will produce nice photo."
This bouncy house has been a lifesaver for our 3 kids during social distancing. A little smaller than we pictured but still a good size. The kids do collapse the top section if they are wrestling but that's expected. Great value for the price
"These folders are perfect for placing certificates in.  They make a beautiful presentation.  I am having the name of the training facility, and the name of each student printed in the same gold colour, on the front.  I will buy them again."
"This is an amazing shirt. If you have an athletic build it is awesome, a real compliment getter. If you want a more fitted feel for your physique, I would advise ordering down a size or 2, it is extremely stretchy. All in all, a great shirt for the money."
I'm really enjoying using these!They are great for Bible journaling and such pretty colors!The bag that comes with them is a really great bag and fits in the bag I keep my Bible and stuff like that in!I recommend them to anyone!
"I purchased three of these for use in our Fireworks Fundraiser Tents, all performed flawlessly.  I was fortunate to have been made aware that only Socket series 7 scanners had be approved for used on iPads  with the Square POS app."
"Great paper.  We use this paper at the office and now I use in my home office, it has proven one of the best if not the best.  we tried many brands, thickness and brightness.  navigator platinum 99 brightness, 20lb very seldom jams up or curls"
"It doesn't look like the picture, the jewel looks a little fake and the flower is dark blood red(which I loved) and smaller, I have the necklace and matching bracelet as a gift and my sister loved it, totally recommend this"
These are all the rage with kids right now and the newest type of fidget.As a teacher I purchased one but find it to be very loud.Also the motion is not fluid like some of the ones I have used before
"Got these for my now ex, who is a writer, and likes to say she‚Äôs not into big woowoo, but who also self-identifies as being accurately Taurus. üôÉPerfect affordable gift for anyone who uses pencils for writing, displaying, loaning, or chewing."
"Great for the vehicle, office, or even at home on the couch. My teeth feel fresh out of the dentist after every use (daily flossing included).I wouldn‚Äôt say these whiten my teeth, but I can see a bit of positive change in the appearance (heavy coffee & red wine drinker)"
I like having a variety of colors for my reading glasses.  I use these frequently. They work very well. The strength I chose works great for computer work throughout the day. No glare. No blur. No bifocal. And the color is perfect.
"[[VIDEOID:ea4d81f4bc74e54879889e9b1baa71a3]] This STEM toy is fun and creative. My 8 yr old sun loves it and made this racing car by himself. After the assembly, kid can play the final result as a remote controlled car. It‚Äôs really a good toy to 8-12 yr old kids. Recommend it!"
Big upgrade over normal office chair wheels..  You'll find your gliding around your office for the hell of it..  Seriously you never realize how rough and loud normal chair wheels are until you replace them with something better..
"Great value for elderberry gummies! Not overpriced like so many others. So many options on the market and this one is a stand out. The texture and flavor are good. Not over gelatin nor too sugary. Easy chew, good size."
"I lve this style of back scrubber, not just for my back but for the back of my legs and even the bottoms of my feet.  I highly recommend them, especially if you are not as physically limber as you used to me (like me)."
"Great looking  rosaries,  great quality and was suprised on how durable it was i fell asleep with it on and it did not break or tangle. not only does this product look good it's great quality also and durable"
"Very cute. I bought these for my aquarium. Of course they are so light weight, I had to glue them to a rock or shell to hold them down but they would be perfect for a fairy scene or for a dollhouse etc."
"A good choice for holiday letters. Easy to fit text and cheerful design. Occasionally sheets stuck together in printer, especially the one last few sheets in printer tray. Sheets just thick enough for 2sided printing w/o bleed thru. Good value."
"Pins are very nice. When reading description, I was concerned that they might be too small. They are just right for lapels, vest, or chest.We are a small social club of women. These pins discreetly represents our unity and style without being overbearing or drawing too much attention."
I would not waste your time with this heating pad. I have had two and both stopped working after a month and the second one even melted in one spot. I was so excited about it because of the size but it‚Äôs a waste of money!
I need to know how to work this thing my one dog is scared out of his mind the thing seems to be sounding off constantly instead of only when they bark there was no clear instructions in the box
I loved this dress! I got many complements. I am usually a size small and got a size small and it fit very well. The only thing bad about it was that it was a tad see through. Just wear a slip under it and you should be fine.
This electric shaver is perfect at maintaining my bald head style! It has seven gold floating heads that are diligent at cutting my hair and stubble lowly. It also comes with multiple efficient accessories that give me the power to stay neatly groomed!
Cute. Wrinkly though and material is slightly weird.I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äô‚Äô 134 lbs. small fit but could probably fit in a medium too.Update: after washing itt once and letting it air dry it shrunk like 3 inches! It‚Äôs now way above my ankles. Bummer.
My Hammie Eve loves this case.  She loves climbing up to the second floor and looking out of the cage at eye level with us. It's very roomy. Lots of space for her to build her nest just the way she likes it.
My daughter has had this for about 4 months. She is rough on toys and this has withstood her wild play. She loves all the traps you can put hyenas or lions in. She even uses this to play with her ponies.
This is my second time purchasing this product and I love these silk fasteners! It is a great alternative to to the hang tag gun which often leaves holes in clothing and also harder to use. Using a safety is easier and more efficient while packing orders.
"I am tall and heavy set and this shirt just isn't flattering at all.  For some reason it hangs wrong.  I thought I was going to really like it and maybe a shorter waist girl that is smaller might fit into it better.  I am 5'8"" tall."
Shirt fits pretty tight. Definitely a stretchy conforming material and not a regular t shirt material. Also the flower on the front is like a slab of plastic glued to the shirt. It is cute though if you don't mind this material and order like 2 sizes up.
"I bought this product to test writing on different surfaces and so far it's a good marker: it can write on wood, paper, glass, plastic, etc. and has a nice fine tip to allow some detailed handcrafts. I recommend if you need a good replacement for the expensive sharpies."
"The apron is horrible. It‚Äôs ugly; the material is hideous. Oh, they‚Äôre probably durable, and most definitely water resistant. But do you want to wear a rain slicker in your kitchen? And an ugly one at that? I almost cried when I opened the box!!!"
"Bought this ink as it was the first one that popped up on my search, my printer rejected it, and the HP support said it will ruin the printer. I am 2 days out of my return window so out $40+"
i recommend. Its just that i somehow ordered  wrongly and didn't notice i was ordering a toddler size....so it didn't fit my school boy son.  We are trying to sell it now.  Anyone want it? email me at cobist@hotmail.com
"the leather cover is beautiful.but, compared to the first leather notebook I had bought here, this is a this and robbed version. pages are not sewn, only stuffed n held by rubber bands. pull - and they are out.anyway. get a notebook from a different seller"
"Pros:CheapCool lookingCons:Very, very poor quality frames, don't even close correctlyLenses smudge very easilyDoesn't actually shield your eyes from the sunBottom line: You get what you pay for. I shouldn't have been so frugal and paid a few bucks more for sunglasses of much better quality."
Having difficulty with page as I didn't order the last purchase. It looked like it was piggybacking on a separate order. I may have unintentionally touched the product but still having a hard time getting refund. Will call bank today and see why purchase is still pending.
I only wish there was a better way to ship these without them getting crushed. They are not the easiest to get to hold a proper shape once they're squashed in shipping. Tgevsides were also glued upwards so it doesn't quite look the same as the picture.
"My husband really enjoyed wearing the hat during beach vacation. It was comfortable, he did not feel hot, and gave him great face coverage. It stayed on well for the most part, but heavy winds did take it right off his head. Our 6 year old liked wearing it too!"
"I‚Äôm ok with the color variation, but please note its not RED! I did have a little trouble measuring because I wasn‚Äôt exactly sure where to measure based on the description. However, it does fit!üêæ It fits nicelyüêæ Nice quality knitüêæ Cute scarf detailüêæSeems warm and comfortable to my dog"
"Based on reviews that it was sized bigger, I ordered a S instead of a M and it fit perfectly! I was impressed that the fabric was not see through. Wearing it all day it held its shape and did not stretch. I feel comfortable wearing this dress anywhere."
This was a good quality and unique birthday card. It had a lot of interesting information that my partner enjoyed reading about on his birthday! The envelope was also good quality and a ‚Äúseal‚Äù sticker came with the care which was a neat addition!
Great sculpt and paint application. Face looks spot on. Excellent execution on the pose. The anatomy and angles look on point. He's a little more tan than the photos but nothing too crazy. Very unique look with his ghost companion. A bit more lengthy than your typical Banpresto.
"Seems like it would be a good product, if I could fit in them.  I would typically wear a 42 in wrangler, lee, or lucky brands.  The 4xl is maybe a 40.  True to fit does not describe this products size"
"I gave this as a Winter gift to a friend who always has cold feet!  Her bedroom has a Jungle theme, so the giraffe sits right on her bed during the day, and warms up her feet at night! She loves it!!"
Totally a waste of money. The water spills over the side and huge TS stuck in the rim. There‚Äôs no way to carry a bowl with water on the rim to the sink very easy... I‚Äôm sure you can picture how that goes.
This fit beautifully under my daughters prom dress.  The dress originally came with one but it was a three tier and you could actually see the bands within it.  This filled out the dress perfectly and fit so nice.
My kiddies love qixels but this set was a little different than previous sets we have purchased. The plates and templates are different and therefore cant be used with other qixel templates. Babies still managed to make awesome creations! Cool metallic pieces tho!
"This was not a fun puzzle - we are puzzle fans - this one is not well constructed, thin pieces all look the same.  We had to tape it together to check the backs for fit - very frustrating!"
"I have 2 of these for my outside cats, I put a blanket inside, they love their houses and the houses were very easy to put together, took me about 15 min. each to build.  Great quality for the price!!!"
"I love these cards. They are so novel, and really make an impression. They are not that much more expensive than the cards you get in the supermarket, but at least here you are getting something thats well made and really 'pops' when put on display."
Easy to set up. Very nice appearance. Good build quality. Metal dish that's easy to clean. Battery or AC powered. I'm impressed. Weird brand name but a quality product. Best of all it's easy to program. With our previous feeder I needed to review my college degree to program it.
It took me a while to actually buy this because it‚Äôs a bit pricy but I bought it because I couldn‚Äôt find anything with the same finish that I liked. I love the product but still think the price is too high.
"I love seeing what appears to be natural red hair, since we don't see it much nowadays. My daughter also loves it. And we appreciate how classy this doll looks. Who needs over-sexed appeal, in what is supposed to be, a GIRL'S doll?"
I am using this in my bathroom floor as I sit on the throne. It works well for grounding (tested with meter). I use it with my own cord that has an alligator clip (Pureground). This is very thin material. I expected something a bit thicker.
It's pretty safe to use this. The top locks and it won't allow you to open it until the heating component cools down. I think I'm more excite about this then my 6 year old.Be advised: some if the cheaper crayons won't melt.
"I really wanted to like these. Unfortunately, they do not block noise. They would be perfect for noisy environments that you don‚Äôt mind having some sound coming through. But, if you need quiet for sleeping (noisy partner), they did not work. At all."
"Bought these for both back-to-school and for work-from-home. I typically like Zebra pens, though I usually get a different style. These were more economical, and I really like the way they write (which is why I typically like Zebra pens). Very smooth."
"This is great! Sturdy enough to last us until Halloween and yet breathable enough to wear now! My son loves to wear this costume! It‚Äôs his absolute favorite, and I don‚Äôt have to worry about him ruining it. It‚Äôs great material!"
"This tank top is very long, thicker material, and with a shelf bra.  The fit is as expected. I ordered 2, plan to order some more colors.  Love for being comfortable at home and bedtime.  Can even dress them up if you wanted to."
"Great work socks. Husband works 12+ hour shifts, on his feet all day and these socks last close to a year before they start to wear out. Worth the money for sure, these are the only kind of socks he'll wear for work!"
Will probably use as a Halloween costume. Whole left buttcheek hangs out. Glue was visible on rhinestones and had to pick off. If you‚Äôre looking for a costume it‚Äôs fine. If you wanna wear it out on a night out with friends maybe not
If you are looking to add that casino touch I cannot express how much I recommend this banner and table cloth. Everyone loved it. The quality of the banner is A+. Table cloth was long for a 8 chair table. Worked fantastic for us.
"I use this Red Palm Oil mixed into my cockatiel's pellets. He loves the flavor, and it is providing him with nutrients he is not otherwise getting. My little guy is ten years old, has regular Veterinary check-ups and is in great health."
"At the time I received these, before the Pandemic was in full outbreak....they came at a perfect time, perfect condition and used constantly.A USA distributor that could be trusted, were affordable and delivered on time!It's sad they are no longer available."
The material is very high quality and is very thick. It runs true to size. It doesn‚Äôt really cinch in your waist. The top is really nice and has removable inserts though I don‚Äôt recommend it for high intensity workouts. It wouldn‚Äôt provide too much support
"The play mat is super detailed and looks awesome when I'm play, great for an operating or abandoned military facility scenario for modern or futuristic table top war gaming, will definitely get another from you guys, also an add on carry on bag! What! Very nice addition, thank you!"
I had my first lead holder for 18 years.  It finally was worn beyond repair. That is why I searched for its identical replacement.  You cannot go wrong with these lead holders.  They are capable of withstanding construction work site abuse for many years.  Love it!
"The printer has been used in a office setting and so far no issues. I had made some noise month ago, but so far it working good. We network scan without a issue, and the printing comes out quick. Good printer."
"so, the set comes with 2 tins. mint condition, with awesome cards. the fact is that since they both cost you 20$ a piece, getting them for 30 is a heck of a steal. its well worth it. got awesome cards, 2 ghost rares. and card car d"
"This is a decent simple eyeglass case.  I was kind of hoping it would be a little bit more rigid, so it would stand upright in my purse for easy dropping-in of my glasses.  But it protects my glasses and it's good for the price."
"I've been looking for stylish dog sweaters for some time.  They have lots for little dogs, but not for bigger dogs.  Chilly Dog sweaters are not only stylish, but very well constructed and just too darn cute!  I'm buying more!"
"I'd beenin pain for weeks, typical for October/Novembe,r but within days, I was pain free.  No, I don't work for the company. I'm just a citizen. I hope it works for you.  PS:  Walmart has it, and it costs much less."
"Pretty unhappy with these dice. The inking looks patchy and grey in places, and the worst is the d6 which is much wider in one direction than the other and not square at all. The color and shimmer are more dull than I expected. Wouldn't recommend."
"I really like these replacement pads for my Swiffer Steamboost mop.  They are easy to put on and it is great that the cleaner is already there.  I have bought many of these replacement pads and when I tried a cheaper brand, I came right back to these."
Got these for our family costume as the pictures show people of all ages wearing them. I knew I would have to tighten them down for the kids but they were to small for the grown ups. And the the edges are very scratchy
"Awesome, great product. It took me 4 cleanings. Get it if you cannot print,because your head is clogged.You will be surprised.The picture on left original, on the right a copy. Great results, when 1/2 hour ago could'nt print at all."
"I purchased these bags and I am very pleased with them.  I like the feel of the bag, and they appear to be strong.I thought the price was a good value.  I will be purchasing these bags again.I was given a discount to review these bags."
These bags are pretty thin but also perfect to give a gift in. They aren't too small and not too large either. Really ideal for family gift exchange or something similar. Nice thank you tags come along with the bags as well.
Wow!  Everyone I give these to is REALLY impressed!  They just LOVE them - and I LOVE GIVING them to everyone!  The price might be a bit much - BUT - it's WORTH IT!!  They are spectacular and make me feel really good about giving them!!
This chair is VERY UNCOMFORTABLE ü•µ feels like I am sitting on a metal bar. Very little cushion on the seat. Also when I move in the chair it makes very loud squeaky metal scraping noise. Wish I could return not worth what I paid for. Very disappointed
"These came in the perfect size to use up table space. I don‚Äôt usually like to get many different types of desserts, so these helped the table look full and fun. It has been a week since our party and they are still blown up and intact!"
"Ordered these for my kids . Awesome price, but had a really weird smell. Unfortunately, my kids are really picky and didnt like the taste of them . My kids didnt care for them, but worth a try for the price :)"
You can never go wrong with any Chris Christensen brushes. I‚Äôm just adding to my collection. I also use them on my own hair. I still have my very first brush from 10 years ago. They keep making better ones.
"This thing is huge!  I can fit all of my oils in here and it is so much easier to deal with than my giant wooden box i was using before.  And the oils fit perfectly.  5, 10, 15 mL  Love the design, too."
"The adjustable/sliding hardware on each side of the coupler is plastic. I have two medium sized dogs (40-45 lbs each). They saw a squirrel and pulled hard, together once and both plastic pieces snapped, making the coupler completely unadjustable and lax. Made them unusable."
I usually give good reviews for most of the products I buy but I‚Äôm very disappointed with this one. I do not recommend this brand. The screw cap is of poor quality and can‚Äôt screw tight at all. Waste of money.
This Cheese Macaron treat was unique and my puppy loved it. She couldn't stop for asking more. The only thing is it was hard to break it eventhough mh puppy gas strong and sharp teeth.She seemed at first was struggling.
"I got it as a Christmas present for my niece who is 18 months old and she loved it. It is great for her hand-eye coordination and she laughs every time she manipulates it and makes a ""funny"" noise. Great choice as a stocking stuffer. üëå"
If the item is too close to your internet modem it creates noise. When I moved the set away from the modem it worked perfectly. The sound was great. Case and point. It picks up interference from different frequencies. I cannot complain for the price. Its perfect!
"I had a brush like this for my silky terrier and it works perfectly for my Maltese mix as well! The double sides are awesome! One side to get out the knots and the other side to make their fur super soft and shiny! Get this, don‚Äôt question it!"
Nice packaging but the product does not recognise handwriting well to convert to text.  Also simple numbering notes doesn‚Äôt get translated properly to text format.  Nice package but the handwriting to text feature is not at all as described.  Sorry but returned it.
"I bought the huge one and people went so crazy over it that I'm now buying smaller ones for friends. A nun at my church was so enchanted by it that I just had to get her one, too. Elegant and very inspirational. I'll probably have to buy more soon!"
The sizes were completely incorrect on these shoes........I ordered the smallest size for my 9 lb Maltese and the shoes were large enough to fit a Labrador.  I measured them just as the website said but they were way too large.
This feels like very cheap quality and the packing makes it feel as if it's of lower quality. I'm glad I found a coupon code because this is definitely not worth the list price of $99! But it gets the job done I guess.
This is the best pic I got of me wearing the thicker belt.. but it was perfect for my outfit and you can adjust it to fit your body shape. I'm about a size 14 (XL in shirts) and it fit me perfect!
I ordered a XL ...Nice fit ... I am 5‚Äô10 230 pounds with a large rump and small waist the fit well loose around my waist but a belt will take care of that. I will be ordering them in all colors!!!
"I was satisfied with this product upon receiving it.  The tubes were a bit bigger around then I expected, but it really makes no difference.  A fun tool to use with elementary students!  Great price for 3 wands!"
"Awesome color, as pictured. Purchased for Christmas and was very proud to give it to my son. Wish I could outfit him in these shirts as he loved it. Easy care and easy clean no ironing, make sure to follow washing directions. No fading so far. Thanks, Awesome."
Very nice clickers with arm bands. A variety of colors and no logo on them. They are perfect to hand out to my customers. They all seem very well made and I have not found any broken in the package I got.
Our Sun Conure liked this very much when we hung it in his cage. But he as been chewing on it and gradually destroying it over a few months. Lost the flat bottom and chewed holes in it. Also delivery time was very long.
It‚Äôs just what I thought and the attached part is great so far I love it all it doesn‚Äôt slide or come off and the extension part to slide your badge is just as long as my works so it is long enough
my fault- i should have looked a bit more carefully at the picture - Los Angeles is actually with a lower case L on the keychain and it does look kind of dumb as it looks like lOS not LOS
I bought this product for my three granddaughters for Christmas. I wasn‚Äôt sure if they would even like it but I‚Äôm trying to expose them to music. They love it! And the features built into it to assist them are great. Excellent product!
Shirt is light-weight but not cheep or thin. Great color and linen texture. It came fairly wrinkled (as to be expected with this fabric) We haven‚Äôt washed it yet... I‚Äôm interested to see if color will bleed and if it will shrink.
"This is my 3rd year using this planner‚ÄîI am a repeat customer! It‚Äôs a convenient size yet has plenty of room to write on each day. My favorite feature is the weekly top three section, which reminds me to focus on the big picture. Highly recommend!"
Wasn't worth how expensive it is what they say the but all this research and development into the water but how so little Intel of proof their work inside their on laboratory O what their water can I can't do
"I got this as a Christmas gift for my sister. She is going to love this! It really holds a good amount of brushes, and is sturdy enough to not fall over when using. Great idea for a brush holder."
5xl is small in the USA this is rip off Chinese tactics is fraudulently advertised wrong zise is all a totally sucks is like a fleas Market made in Cuba with Russian support is demagogue no wonder Jeff Bessos is not the CEO
Received this puzzle as a gift. Working it was a frustrating experience since [[ASIN:B01CTDA8B6 Andrews + Blaine Glitter Central Park Puzzle (1000 Piece)]] pieces were missing and one piece did not fit anyplace. I agree with other reviews: poor quality. Am also contacting Andrews Blaine directly.
"This is SUPER cute! I am so excited to give it to my 3 year old for Christmas, she will love it. She is borderline obsessed with the wizard of oz and asks &#34;Are you a good witch or a bad witch?&#34;.  It's great quality and well made."
"My recent rescue, a tiny Chihuahua we have named Cady, loves these and they are small enough for her. Even though she isn't a puppy (we don't think), these are perfect for her and she waits at the pantry for her morning Dentastix."
"My poodles love these chews.  They're the right size and the way they devour these bones, the taste must be great too.  I only wish they would last a little longer.  It's keeps them occupied for about 5 minutes.  LOL"
"Never gotten a bad puzzle from M&D, my only complaint is that sometimes they come still halfway assembled from the factory, but they're never still connected due to poor cuts, the cuts are well stamped, they just have not always been pulled apart."
"I haven't washed it yet, but my 19 year old cat absolutely LOVES curling up in this bed.  She has numerous beds, but since I gave her this bed, it's the only one she'll sleep in.  That makes both of us very happy!"
"These are very good for the price.  I like my Adidas equivalent socks better, but I got six of these for the price of two of the Adidas.  These are about equivalent to the Fruit of the Loom socks.  I am happy with the purchase."
"The dress is just as pictured(the jewel comes unattached, look in the pouch)! The lining, gloves and chocker are nice and soft. Just add a petticoat for a fluffier skirt! I can't wait for my goddaughter to wear this! üòÅ"
I'm a solid 8 in fit & flare dresses. I needed a small in this very stretchy dress.  The fabric isnt the highest quality but for once or twice a year it works well. I wore it to a work Christmas party & Santa loooved it!
Perfect fit (other reviewers stated it was tight). Mine fits in perfect. I was looking for something to carry my Spark in while flying. Easy to grab it out of at the airport for security. I also ordered a tablet mount and it fits in the case also. Love it.
"This is the best raincoat I‚Äôve ever owned. Love the fleece lined pockets with zippers, the big hood fits great over my head, even when I have my hair up in a bun. Love the sleek look while still keeping me warm and dry."
Not sure why Amazon is giving me this page in Spanish... But great cutouts with small sticker circles to paste to the wall. I think you should use 2 or 3 per cutout because a couple fell on me when I was being stingy.
"Pretty and sparkly and looks classy. The clip can be a little hard to undo, though. I had a mild panic thinking I'd never be able to get it out, but it did release eventually. I've also heard that's common with clickers, so don't let it deter you too much."
I‚Äôve bought a few of these Rotring pens. I don‚Äôt understand why some of them are great and some of them are jank. This one was crap. I have to really shake it like nuts to get the ink flowing.
"This Thanos is big and heavy, watch your toes for falling, thrown, or dropped Thanos lol. We bought it as a gift for our 3yo son. He absolutely loves it, takes it everywhere, stretches it, beats it up, sleeps with it etc. it has held up very well."
"this is a great brush.  i didn't like the steel combed brushes, cause it hurt the dog.  this is much better.  i just hope it can get the loose hair, not cause it can't, just her hair is REALLy short."
"This never seemed to charge well via usb and when it did, it lasted a week before needing to charge again and now it does not charge or work at all and we have only had it for 2 months. Very disappointed."
Bought this as a travel pump to use on long drives. Was barely able to get much milk. My home pump I'm able to fill a bottle in less than 5 minutes. This one I barely get 1 1/2oz in 10 minutes
this leash unraveled at the friction spot in the first 10 min of using.  I was so disappointed.  I wanted this to be my show lead beggars it looks really nice and it's the perfect thickness.  what a waste.
"Pretty good. Print is clear but not exactly VIVID, nevertheless it's a very good quality sign on medium strength aluminum. Shipped inside a medium thickness brown envelope via USPS. Amazing that it wasn't bent. Two holes on R & L are small but easily enlarged for stainless steel bands."
The seat is thin and the manner in which the chair transforms into a seated position is awkward.  The arm rests do not come up with the back of the chair.  They have to be pulled upward along with the back of the chair at the same time.
"I ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô° IT! you can't get any better quality-wise. I have had mine hanging from my Hamptons Weekender bag, which has over a year of daily use, and the glitter is still all attached- sparkling away like the first day."
"Bought this for my wife because we go away on weekends and she normally doesn't take anything with us because the hotel room has a blow dryer so I took took this for her and she loved it. It's small enough, perfect for traveling."
"It was the size I expected, but the corners curled when I took it out of the laminator if I didn't sit something on the corners for a few seconds while it cooled. It seemed thinner than other 3 mil products I use."
"Finally, we have warm enough weather to get the sprinkler going in the back yard.  This is especially fun for the little guys, who are intrigued by where the water‚Äôs coming from.  This was an instant hit and kept everybody cool until the sun went down!"
I've been using for 2 weeks (2x a day) for my 8 yr old lab/husky mix. Wondering how long it takes before it works? As of now there is zero improvement. He's still itchy & seems uncomfortable. Was so hopeful :(
"I chose this product because it was a good combination of methylated forms of B9 and B12 at a fair price, and I don't want the higher 15mg dose of folate many vendors fixate on. No taste issues but my shnozzle ain't very sensitive. So far so good."
"Would have been five stars, if product I received was the same pictured, 250 feet of twisted, white wire, was an unpleasant surprise. Luckily half is buried and the other will be covered (hopefully) by pine straw next fall. Other than that, the product works as intended for underground fence."
"I like it but it seems that it was packaged carelessly. I had a missing button, the watch was out of its container in the package. The container was bent and there was a minor stain mark of some sticky substance. Other then that, i do like the watch"
I bought these pj's for my 12 year old first.  She loved them so much I bought a pair for my 10 year old and myself.  They are super warm.  I love that the feet zip off on the adult sizes.
The actually work! I have three big dogs and they are all different and it worked for all three of them. My german shepherd is the hyperactive one and I'm a very please dog mom. I recommend these to any dog owner.
I had hopes for this but saw a few reviews that said it broke after a few uses. Upon taking it out of the torn and broken box I noticed it was already cracked. Returning it immediately. Listen to the reviews - not we‚Äôll made at all
The map itself is decent. The text is legible but I would qualify it as high quality. Map was damage what looks like during the packaging stage. Which cause the map to be crumpled along the edges including a small tear in a few places.
"LCR goes with us everywhere, since it‚Äôs so small. It fits in a purse or glovebox, so you can take it with you easily. Not only is it fun, but it‚Äôs so easy to learn that it‚Äôs good for all ages. Highly recommend this game!"
"Impressed with the speed of delivery! Theo only problem I had with this product was that at times, multiple sheets would get sent through while printing. It seems like static keeps them stuck together. I think if they had a feed strip, it would help separate them during print."
"This isn‚Äôt slime. It‚Äôs a giant mess waiting to happen. Both my daughter and I tried to play with it and it just sticks to our hands, even when trying to roll it around to get it off. There‚Äôs no scent either, other than slime scent."
"I‚Äôve had this fountain since June and it‚Äôs already stopped working. I made sure to keep up on filter changes and cleaned it thoroughly every time I replaced the water, but it doesn‚Äôt even trickle out of the top anymore. I‚Äôm bummed and so are my cats."
"This is a large wristlet that I use when I don't feel like lugging around my giant purse, but I want to carry around more than just a license and some cash. It's very cute and I've gotten quite a few compliments on it."
I ordered a large because I have long arms and like my hoodies to be a little...not much...longer than my hands...and this hoodie is as expected. Perfect. I was hoping I didn't get it too large. Btw...I am 5'8&#34; 154lbs...love love love it. All my softball teammates will be envious.
"I am impressed by the quality of NERF products for dogs, I have an aggressive chewer that likes to take the squeaker out of balls.  The squeaker is still intact and the dogs love to play with their Nerf ball."
Superior quality for an umbrella. My husband carries one in his work bag at all times. We have ordered them for gifts and own three ourselves for when we have company. Just remember: BUTTON FOR OPEN AND CLOSE!!!You will break the umbrella otherwise.
"I love love love this weekly planner! Much better quality than the last at-a-glance one I ordered,  that this was a replacement for.  I could transfer the rest of thid year over,  and all of next year is covered already! It's so cute!!!!"
Total garbage. Seams are splitting and pulling apart before our dog even touched it. Dog pulled it apart in less than 5 minutes and he isnt even a big destroyer. This is going back same day as I got it. Total wast of time and my shipping costs back.
Have had multiple car seats over time and this is by far the best !Fits my two toy poodles comfortably with room to lay down.  Very thick and comfortable for them. Safer and much more cozy than those hanging flimsy ones.  Well worth the investment !
"It was easy to assemble. It was very small, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs for a hamster but maybe a small mice. My hamster immediately chewed the maze and kept escaping from the the top lid above the maze section. Used one day and back to the old cage Gucci went."
Son liked it. Fit well and its a beautiful royal blue color.  Quality seems good.  My son is 10 and size 6 fit him well.  Played BB game the day the shoe came in and had no problems in fit or comfort.
"Really cute and good fit for the price. Definitely review the sizing chart. I am 5&#34;6&#34; 140lbs. Usually wear a medium or 4-6. I got a large in this and it fit well, I likely could have gone with the xl and fit in that too."
"I bought a stamp for myself with a symbol on it. That worked well so I bought this for my son with his 3 initials.  With the ball being round and the stamp being flat, you can't get a good image on the ball without smearing the print."
"Got these for our daughter's wedding.  Clips are sturdy and hold tightly.  That was my most major concern, whether they would pull off of the pants. The leather portions do look cheaper, but for the price and the suspenders being under the coat...they were just fine."
"Comfortable cotton jersey PJ's, but sizing runs a bit small.  Normally wear a size 6 to 8.  Ordered a medium for a looser fit, but medium fits more like a small.  Can wear, but not as loose fitting as I'd prefer for sleepwear."
I have thick thighs and these pants fit comfortably on my thighs and my waist. There is an extra pocket in the waist band that is perfect for ID‚Äôs and debit cards. Love how stretchy they are (Picture shows how much room I have) and I love the pockets!
"Feels like it has more polyester than cotton, all other descriptions by the manufacturer appear to be right on, the double cuff buttons, reversible cuffs, spread collar, chest pocket. This shirt is a darker blue that the light blue pictured."
"UPDATE: Velcro is messed up and we did not even use it that much.Size 3 fits my 5 lb toy poodle perfect, a size 4 might even fit her too. I just wish the Velcro was better, it looks like it might not last too long."
SO Much Bang for your Buck!! Collars are Well made and they‚Äôre nice fabric and hardware. Super cute for the Holiday Season!! I will be looking to purchase 2 more from this company hopefully in different colors for the spring. Look SO Adorable on my pups
It hardly sticks to the wall so we just stuck it to the cat tree. The cats immediately inhaled the ‚Äútreat‚Äù ball but one one of the two cares cares about the others. As you can see. We‚Äôve had it for months now and still no really impact
"This sweet little bed is fluffy and SO soft. My littlest pup Jasper loves it, perhaps even more than he loves my lap! Jasper weighs around 8 or 9 pounds, and it is a perfect for for him. Would work well for kitties, too."
"My daughter's feet were sopping wet after she wore these for the first time in wet snow - socks dripping wet!! Terrible boots, also wind and snow can get right in via the open top. They look like boots but do not act like boots. AVOID!"
"Just received this, and the nozzle of my vacuum(Shark Rotator Professional Lift Away) is the same size as the FurVac Accessory. So it's not usable to me. Not even with the attachment that comes with it that supposedly says &#34;it fits all vacuum sizes&#34;. I want my money back."
"I fell in love with this as soon as I opened it.Very detailed.Very very durable. It's a super strong cover and the pages are nice and thick.Helps to get organized and keep appointment dates.And it's a ""looker"" üíúVery lovely product.I would for sure recommend buying this."
"The hat itself is great, faded to look vintage absolutely adorable. The printing is literally just iron on sticker type of letters but considering how inexpensive the price to customize is it met my needs. I would definitely order again."
"I opened the tube and my cat ran. He wouldn‚Äôt even come close to it or me, while it was in my hand. My dog licked the tube and drooled all in my floor. He even took off running from it. What a tragic waste of money."
"I purchased these in the past and liked them so much I purchased more.  I teach and I primary use them to hold class information such as syllabus, calendar, to-do lists, lecture notes, etc.  I use the different colors for different classes."
Not my favorite but a great addition either way. I just think she looks funny. The hair didn't have the heart like it was supposed to though. I was just a round circle. Also she had a few paint smudges but overall she wasn't horrible.
I use these in my classroom for my students for stress release and nerves control. They love them. I only gave it 4 stars because they had a slight odor to them when received. But they aired out easily and the odor is gone.
"I bought this to replace a similar collar that my dog used for almost 10 years. This rubber material does not get stinky like the nylon collars. Its easy to wipe off, easy to adjust, I'm very pleased with the purchase."
Truly have a gift with making such beautiful  outfits they are absolutely gorgeous!!!!This is perfect for my 8yr old.Everyone this is a 5 star rating these clothes are stunning just like you see in the picture and great material.
"We've used this for everything from pizza to chicken parmesan. It's amazing! We had some we had bought at a local store, and then we ran out and couldn't find it locally. My picky-eater son asked specifically for it, so we found it on Amazon. YUM."
This is definitely NOt sized correctly. Would not fit and I checked the size chart. Very disappointed and will return. You would need to order a size 5 times up and hope that fit. Extremely disappointed as I like the top.
Some of the questions were redundant or silly so I tossed about a 1/3 of the cards and will use the rest as ice breakers at training sessions.  I was using questions I found on the internet but this is cuter.
"It looks exactly like the photo and she rides it constantly. It‚Äôs slow and no matter how hard she works to make it faster, it only goes so fast. Great for younger children, but the older the more they won‚Äôt be interested due to speed."
"....and man are they great!  Easy to change out blades...easy to clean....a bit heavy, but that's where I am certain the longevity comes in.  Purchased a #5 ceramic Andis blade for my Cavalier King Charles and it was the perfect cut!"
These are perfect.  The face mask lanyard is just the right size and is adjustable.  No more laying you face mask down or stuffing into a purse or pocket when it is not needed and no chance of losing it.
"This glove is amazing, I have a short tabby hair cat and he hate the regular brush, I tried it on him and  I‚Äôm finally able to clean his fur, I fully recommend this product, my others cats  love it too."
"Honestly, I had hopes for this leash. It‚Äôs so cute! However, it‚Äôs cheap! I haven‚Äôt even had the leash for a month as yet and already it‚Äôs broken. My dog is only 4lbs, so I was shocked at how easily this thing broke while I was out walking my dog."
"These batteries work great on a Arduino MKR1000 after minor modifications.1. Carefully remove the pins from the connector.2. reinsert the pins with the black wire is on the right with the indexing tab on top,3. If necessary, lightly file the indexing tab with an Emery board to fit."
"These are the best little playsets! My 6byear old has the Hansel and Gretel and Goldilocks sets, she LOVES THEM! I think it's way more imaginitive than typical plastic doll houses and toys too. And cuter than lego building sets."
"I was looking for a larger pad as my mouse kept slipping off the smaller pads, I really did not need a pad this large but it works, water resistant, smooth surface and holds many items for my work desk, mouse and keyboard, recommended."
"Now, your watermelon lover can enjoy the image of his/her favorite fruit all year long. It's an addition for the Christmasstocking. Do be prepared to carefully put this together in its 3-D configuration. It's not too difficult. It cheers anyonein the midst of Winter."
"They look to be made well and durable. However, for both my son and daughter that wear ear plugs.  Anytime they jump in a pool the head bands fall off too easy.  We went to swim caps that stay on better."
"The shirt was clearly used and had marks on it. No tags. Returning due to poor quality.It appeared to fit as expected. I didn't even try it on since I was so disgusted with the delivery. The material is cheap, shiny types."
"My 2 cats love these toys. It was a great buy. Each cat has a preference for some of the toys. Keeps them entertained.  Neither has been brave enough to enter the tunnel, but they are thinking about it. Very happy with this purchase."
"First ReviewWe ordered the cartridge on May 13, 2013.  We are just replacing the cartridge on June 4, 2014.  Glad to find it lasted for over a year!Second ReviewToday is September 23, 2015.  I just ordered another cartridge.  The second cartridge lasted for over 15 months!"
"I've had these coin holders for several months now and realized that in those few months, the coins 'cut' the pockets and the coin falls out.  I've had to start taping the pocket so I don't lose the coin. they are not strong pockets. very disappointing"
"I've not had this long,  but I love how wide it is.  You can actually relax on it and not worry about it flipping over.  It seems to be made pretty sturdy.  I really love mine!"
The rear leg extension doesn't align with the rear arm and it will scratch the mavic body everytime folding/unfolding the drone. Not a big deal but consider that's a $10 accessory and it will likely just cost 1 buck for manufacturing.
Everything was beautiful. The color was bright and lovely and the wood frame was very nice. I purchased it for a retirement gift for a person I felt had everything and I wanted to give something unique and useful for their world travels. This was perfect for the occasion.
"These are very comfortable and sturdy glasses. Just what I needed for my office and computer work. As a writer, I spend a lot of time in front of my computer and these glasses have definitely helped reduce the resulting headaches. I am quite pleased with this purchase."
"This was my 3rd bag and have have previously been satisfied, but this bag smelled horrible...like a dead fish and hand tons of sand and trash in it.  I had to return it.  I am not sure if I want to try another bag."
"POS. Don't buy it. Glitchy, constantly gives new message waiting when no new message.The ring is earsplitting loud at the softest setting. Obnoxious extended ring when two lines ring in at once. I paid a lot for my system. It's not worth 2 cents."
unfortunately waited too long before I started wearing it and quickly found out that it does not function properly.  It is too late to return it but I definitely got a lemon.  Looks great I like the size and weight of it just wish it worked.
The dress arrived with one of the sleeves detached. The arm strap popped within an hour of wearing it. Fortunately bc it fit well to my body I wasn‚Äôt worried about it falling off. The fabric has some stretch. It‚Äôs a cute but poorly constructed design.
"LOVE this game. BUT WARNING! there are ""mature"" content cards in here. prior to playing with in-laws and parents, my husband and i went through the cards to discard any that were inappropriate for our family friendly setting. thats about 20 cards-very minimal.love the game."
It‚Äôs partially assembled so all you need to do is put in the little tree and that‚Äôs it! It‚Äôs lasted and so easy to clean! Seriously the easiest home/habitat/cage I‚Äôve ever owned! The dropper it comes with is also great! I definitely would recommend!
Same as original valves that came with Spectra pump. Say Spectra on the side. Will order another set as a backup. Tried another generic brand and I didn't pump as much when I used those valves. Not worth messing around with inferior products. Will stick with these!
"Perfect for what I wanted it for! One of the suction cups did break in the installation which is why it is crooked but for the money I spent, I will work with only 3 working suction cups. Very bright color. Nice bubble effect."
The colors are great and it's nice it has a variety of different settings but they are cheap and break easily. If you have small kids who put things in their mouths beware because the button batteries could be swallowed and be very dangerous for a child.
This was not what I was expecting the picture said that it was a 50 pound bag and it was only a 10. That seems to me that is false advertising or at least they would put that is only a 10 pound bag.
[[VIDEOID:e61033b14382c0b669738d525d6eeef0]] Cheap pad with no support. My 9lb Bichon sank as i was trying it out for her. Also it tore as i bent it a bit to put inside cover. Very poor material used. Would NOT recommend nor re-purchase.
Best replacement for an ace bandage I could find for the constant swelling in my knees. Extreme support!!! Thick material that is standing up perfectly sinceI purchased them over a month ago!!! Would highly recommend if you have any type of Arthritis like I do. Great Buy!!
I was so excited to get bubble mix that was made in the USA. However these bubbles didn't do anything. They would pop right away and they wouldn't make big bubbles with the big bubble wands. They wouldn't make bubbles with the stick wands either.
I am not happy with it. I wear L and this two tank top I bought loook like too wide and look like 2xl to me. I‚Äôm so upset please send me a message I want my money back and I want to send this back!!!!!!!
"They are address slips so far goodLoss trust in Amazon purchases. I have a thousand down the line they may be blank. You asked for this I was going to put nice and let it go, but sent it back for a review. I hope the truth do things differently."
"My little grandson loves this & my grown son loves this, too, and wants to take it to set up in his office! It is of great quality & very collectable. It far exceeds expectations & price is great. You can't go wrong!"
"This was a last minute buy, my little girl needed it for her Christmas concert and it got here just in time and fit her perfectly.  She loved it so much that she wore it for Christmas as well"
"It seems nice and solid. I have my carefully selected manicure pieces for home use. I got this to take with me for travel and lookin good so far. The fingernail catcher on the nail clipper is nice touch. It‚Äôs removable too, in case you don‚Äôt like nail catchers."
"Another great pair of Dingo boots!  I love these.  They fit to size, and are super comfortable, even on the first wearing,  I love the black sequin underlays.  These boots are definitely fun, versitile, and make me smile."
"This brushes perform very well. I've used them with high end and drug store pallets and they blend the shadow nicely while applying a lot of color.  I don't know for sure if they're natural hair, but it seems like some sort of badger/goat blend."
"I have a planted 20 gallon high top, bow front,fresh water tank and i recently planted with real plants..this is a must have and is very very well made..love the case and nice drying cloth ..tools are very well made..Im so glad I got this..."
I bought the farm puzzles for my 79 year old father. The puzzles didnt come with a printable to look at while putting the pieces together. The picture on the box is way too small for him. Will not buy again
"Quality is good.Fits well.Material is good.Very comfortable.Length is really good. I don't like the short shorts.Good for summer and fall seasons.Cons.-Not for winter.-Material is very thin.The cons will be pros during the summer. Overally, I love them and will buy again."
"Sorry to say this wasn't the greatest. They tell you not to boil the water, but if you don't it isn't hot enough to make steam. Also the cup is very small, so the steam lasts for about 5 minutes."
This is seriously the cutest collar EVER!!! I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs one of those safe snap collars so I don‚Äôt have to worry about him getting stuck somewhere and hurting himself trying to get out. The plaid pattern is adorable and yet simple.
"These are ok.  They‚Äôre not like the Clarisonic Brand, they‚Äôre less superior.  Super soft bristles.  But they‚Äôll do since Clarsonic products are discontinued.  Note, it took over 3 weeks for these arrive.  No communication from the seller during that 3 week period."
"It's purple.  It's supposed to be purple.  I thought I'd like it in combination with the other blue and whiter lights but I really don't like it at all.  It makes my tank very purple, more so than I expected.  Sorry I bought it."
Fitted great but could not stand the material. Super thin! Had to return the dress just because of the material as the dress was for my holiday party and it would of been too cold!!! Super cute design just would of been great if a different material.
"Obsessed with this laundry soap. The aroma is so fresh, I just can‚Äôt use anything else now. Also it tends to stay with the fabric once it‚Äôs clean, which I really enjoy. Great product, I love that it‚Äôs also cruelty free."
"The size and quality of the tile are satisfactory. The cardboard box is so thin. It torn into pieces upon arrival. If you decide to buy this product, be sure you have another box available to put the set in."
"The envelopes are almost acceptable, linen textured yes, shipped on time, packaged well, white.NOT 70lb weight by any stretch. They are the 28-30LB envelope weight I believe. For comparison, pop a piece of paper off your inkjet printer... that's about the weight you are getting."
"Fabric wasn‚Äôt what i was expecting, I imagined it a little bit more of quality.... but once i wear it it looks good, I have to fix the length because its really long. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2, this was made for 5‚Äô5 girls lol!"
If you have an average or slim foot you will need an insert for the ball of your foot. Straps are long but functional. Haven't worn them for a work day yet. Hopefully they will work and for the price.... I am positive they will.
"Phone fits and all my other stuff, perfectly. This is the only wallet I need for all my stuff.  I would recommend this to anyone needed to keep all your stuff in one place. Good quality for the price."
"It's so cute and pink and uwu!!!!!! I have it set up in my man cave next to my panda ninja and ripped bulbasaur, and it fits perfectly. The paint hasn't begun to flake or chip yet and I've been squeezin it for months now!"
"Exactly as expected, machine washable and super soft. My dog passes out seconds after laying down in the bed, he loves it! My other much larger dog tries to  steal this little bed even though he has his own appropriately sized bed.It has both dogs barking seal of approval!"
I love the support and softness of these socks.  It provides me with all day support without collecting a lot of moisture.  The fit is perfect and it does not roll up or bunch up as other socks do.
"These are very pretty, however you get what you pay for. When you pull the strings  to tie..... hmmm you end up with string in your hands!  Every so often you loose a bag. But definitely beautiful bags!"
If it's anything like the Sunfire I'll probably like it. But i assume it ressembles theRedcat Volcano more than anything. And i have one of those also.Im looking forward to tinkering with the Exceed Infinitive as i just gonna order one tommorow.
"I love the purse, but it smells so bad they don't s no way I can use it.  I've been letting it air out for two weeks. I've tried cleaning it with leather cleaner and soap and water, but it's still terrible."
"I thought that they were a good deal for the cost but was very disappointed in how thin they were and having to fold and fold to get them just right for shipping.I will use them and make due, but dissatisfied with the quality"
"Paddle Boards? Surf Boards? Who cares??? Great purchase, made in U.S.A. with quality materials. Great Beach Island Vibe! It is the eprfect weight and width for my Kala Tenor. Very Happy with my purchase. I guess some folks just cannot find joy!"
My husband and I bought this for a Trunk or Treat venue we were having for our food truck. This was a big attraction for the kids n their parents.  It drew customers to our spot who then bought food.
Return it. If you are trying to put a gift like a small tea set won‚Äôt fit bag is too too small it‚Äôs more for like idk small tee shirt like a baby onesie a birthday card that‚Äôs it 3 stars for graphics on bag very cute
"My (just turned) 4 year old got these for Christmas and LOVES them! He‚Äôs really into transformers and loves that there‚Äôs so many, they‚Äôre all different and that they turn into letters. Highly recommend for pre schoolers! But even my 6 year old has enjoyed transforming them!"
"These work with my Canon and have saved me a FORTUNE. I've printed hundreds of pages of stuff for the PTA, and drafts of my book (upwards of 500 pages) and I hardly ever get low on ink. I highly recommend over name brand. Will continue to buy, for sure."
Love the way this sweater is made.  Fabric is lightweight.  I am however 5'8 1/2 and the sweater is shorter than I like.  Sits just below the natural waist.  If you don't mind just below the natural waist the sweater is a 5 star!
The chair is ok and it's really light and easy to put in a car but with someone in it it's really hard to maneuver around it just doesn't turn easy and it makes it hard to get around the house.
"Loved this dress - the color left something to be desired. I love all my Anni Coco dresses I have bought, and this was no exception - trust me though, and don't get the white unless you want it for a costume. It looks very nurse-ish."
While I love the cage overall it came damaged with the bottom try bent that I had to hammer it out so it works. We also didn't receive the purch that was supposed to come with it. Besides that my bird loves the space
"Works really well, and is probably the best you can get for the money right now for dog training. We use it to curb unwanted behaviour. He doesnt even need to be shocked, really as long as he wears the collar hes good... lol"
"It came looking better than I expected it to! The graphics are very nice and it doesn't smell bad (like I thought it would), and the mousepad is pretty good quality for what you're paying for. Will actually buy again for myself, I think!"
"I used this tape to hang two very light  decorations. Both fell off the walls within days. The second one fell off the wall with the tape attached to the wall. I can't, for love or money, get the tape off of the wall. Don't recommend."
"Bought this for my husband who has a bad knee, they haven't figured out what is wrong yet, but he states it really gets inside the knee, after he uses it, he walks much better, so he is trying to use it regularly everyday after work"
"Love this dress.  It was custom made and fits like a glove. Also, I was emailed from the dressmaker and they could not have been more attentive to my needs. Thank you so much,  the wedding is going to be a real joy for me."
This is definetely one of those cheap waist trainers. It's a great latex trainer but I found it too be too small so I had to send it back. Overall it was made of great material and super super durable.
"Overall these are great quality! There were a few in the bunch that busted before they filled all the way, and a few that fell off before filling but we had such a blast with these!Easy to fill and way less expensive than other brands!!Have already repurchased!!"
"I love it!! This has made working from home 10x better. It comes basically fully assembled, you just put the keyboard shelf on with 4 screws and that‚Äôs it! The quality is amazing, I don‚Äôt know how this isn‚Äôt priced much higher, but I‚Äôm not complaining!"
Kind of flimsy and plain cards. Thought they would have been a little nicer. Cheap. You get what you pay for. Good as extra cards in case I forgot to run out and buy one. Worth the price but don't expect all that much.
For some reason this item cannot be found in stores recently. In fact Amazon didn‚Äôt carry it for a while. This truly helps with dry mouth. When it was not found anywhere I tried some other brands but they weren‚Äôt as good
De verdad el producto no sirve es tan malo que ni como un aud√≠fono normal sirve. La traducci√≥n es p√©sima. No lo compren .Yo lo compre en preventa espere casi un a√±o para que no funcionara y lo triste que despu√©s de recibirlo a la semana le bajaron el precio.
Great price and great buy! My cat goes bonkers for this stuff! They are also well made and stand up pretty well- I have a Savannah breed cat and they are a bit rough on toys. So far they are all still going strong
"Too thick for my purposes.  They are nice but not flexible enough to stay in my trash can.  Since they are a bit thicker, they hold more, but tear easier.  I am donating them to the clean up project."
If you have a home business or doing your taxes this is great. Dual power and runs great on just kitchen light. The numbers are large and easy to read one triple-A battery is included. I like everything about this device.
I purchased this helping a friend start a traveling beauty salon. she said it works but the first few times the nozzle came unattached from the sink and sprayed water everywhere. she said no harm was done and if anything customers had a good laugh.
Second set that I brought for my granddaughter of wooden dolls and the furnitures. She really like playing with them and setting up their houses on the floor or tabletop. Shoes already keep coming off but I got some heavy duty glue (I hope will work)
"Attn:  previous reviewers---this is for a hair salon or barber shop--NOT your home sink.  If you get it for its correct purpose, it works just fine!  The negative reviews aren't accurate because those people tried to put this on their home sink."
Very cute...haven't used yet.  I am glad they came out with a line for nursing accessories.I am in a RN refresher and will be using this week.  I loved their scrub line 5 yrs ago and look forward to many more purchases.
My ferret loves to be there all the time she is resting. She also plays with the ears and tail when she is in that mood.I put it on the wash machine once a week and it is in great shape.
My rabbits loved the hanging treat! They destroyed it in 2 days. It's hard for me to find anything that they'll nibble on that isn't my furniture. They even play with the toys a little bit. I will definitely be purchasing again.
Love this leash. It is very sturdy. Only thing is I wish I would have got the shorter one.  You do need to be careful as my dog pulled for a squirrel and left rope burns on my hand.
Good to keep my PC off the floor but it's a small platform so the entire PC won't fit. Does the job for what I need it for though. Remember to consider if your computer has feet on the bottom as well. May not sit right.
Very easy to apply and sticks onto paper with no issues. Doesn't look like a real wax seal but it still looks nice and gives the over all look. Used it on save the dates and did the job exactly how I wanted.
"Definitely added a pop of color to a black dress I had to wear a strapless bra with. Was very comfortable and fit as expected. The bra itself was not padded, but heavily lined which was alright by me :)"
Didn't know how much I needed this until I actually started using it.  My feet feel better already after just the first use.  Love the ergonomic fit which helps avoid slipping.  Works well and feels like it will last for quite a few years.
"Beautiful, colorful, detailed cards on nice heavy quality paper. The box that they come in is like a bonus, bright beautiful artwork, sturdy and well-made, so when the cards are used up, the box can be repurposed for storing small items, so don't just throw it away!"
This is a really cute game. My granddaughter is seven and I bought this for her for Christmas. She thought it was so funny. It is actually fun to play and the toilet says really cute phrases. I have played it with her.
"This product is great! Although branded for outdoor use, I am using it inside. As soon as I turned it on my puppy immediately stopped barking. She didn‚Äôt appear to be in any pain-just slightly annoyed. Love the compact size as well. Definitely recommend!"
My kids are thrilled about these. They have such fun bright colors and are a better quality than others we have had. They seem durable to last through stretching and aren't sticky which is a huge plus for me since my kids throw them all over the house haha.
"It doesn't fit all seats, but it holds the devices securely when it fits. It can be adjusted to fit a phone or tablet. It comes with instructions, but it is simple to put together. The device feels sturdy enough."
"I got it as a gift for my 1 year old daughter and she loves her little car, plus it has shapes which has helped her with shape recognition, and fine motor skills. As a Preschool Teacher this is a great starter toy for shapes recognition"
Simply use spring water with a drop of Betta water treatment and you save a ton of money.  Simply too small of an amount of water for the price you pay.  I thought it was a gallon container and it was like only 32oz‚Äôs
The Yes is just a very tiny microscreen shaver with a light.  Like any shaver you have to use it all the time.  I thought it was a cheaper version of Nono which is a laser hair removal tool.  I returned it.
"When I walk my pooch, I have to keep an eye on her as she tends to wiggle her way out the leash. Even if I tightened it, somehow she gets out.  I wish it had two latches to be sure my pooch is locked in without worries."
"These notebooks are the only ones I can use any more.  Perfect size, not too thick or thin, paper thick enough so that pens won't bleed through.  Very expensive with shipping, hard to believe these are not stocked in the US..."
This harness is awesome! My puppy stopped pulling the first time she wore it. It was easy to put on and doesn‚Äôt rub on any part of her body. So glad we‚Äôre not pulling her back by the neck anymore on walks.
Mounting hardware was shipped loose in box.Shipping box had a hole in the bottom of box.Half the the mounting hardware was lost.I think Moultrie needs to do a better job in packing. Can't finish putting the feeder together till I purchase some hardware.I am not please with Moultrie.
These are super cute and work amazing in the healthcare field!I‚Äôm a CNA and refuse to spend $40 on a single pair of Stoggles.These have held up so well!!!! The frame style is perfect and I‚Äôve received a few compliments on them.Well worth the buy!!!
Bought these socks because I love them and always go for this brand but the package I received was torn open and one of the socks itself was torn not going to bother returning because they are still usable but still annoying for the price..
"All my kids and I get sick when eating trace amounts of wheat.  Now we can eat anything!  I am not sure how safe it is to use for regular use, so we only use it to eat out about twice a month."
Charge does not last very long. The cover for the charging port will not go back in. Not very adjustable. And the third time I charged it when I removed charging cord it broke a soldier connection so waste of money. And a real bummer.
I love all Gloria Vanderbilt clothes. I ordered this particular color and was very satisfied with color and fit. I am 5'1&#34; 135 lbs. I have several pair of these pants in different colors. I am a very satisfied customer...the waist band gives you a slimmer look.
"My Dino-loving artistic daughter LOVES this. Arrived quickly and in time for Christmas. We don‚Äôt understand why there‚Äôs a lion in there, but the dinosaurs are great!  She‚Äôs giving it a 4 out of 5 stars because of the lion, but would definitely recommend for other artistic dinosaur lovers!"
I don't see what is so great about it. Used it to clean my stainless steel sink but I feel Comet does a better job. This left streaks and residue even after I sprayed it off and then went back over it with a damp cloth.  Not impressed.
this thing is awesome.. I wasn't sure about ordering it with no reviews but it was better than I expected! it's much bigger than I thought it would be and produces so many bubbles. our daughter is having SO much fun with it!
"Bands came as advertised, brand new, great quality and comfortable fit, they do not look like some cheap bands you see around. I would recommend this set for the money. In the picture is just one of the various bands that came in the set."
The belt was comfortable to wear. However I found that it did not get as warm as other belts I have had in the past. The pro of the belt is that it is lighter in weight than other belts.
"I brought 2 of these. They are very nice if you don't want to deal with the headache of a lockbox. They are the perfect size for storing documents,passports,or even a very small laptop computer! They are also travel friendly!"
"I tend to read more than one book at once and needed something to keep my place longer term as I jump around from book to book. These are perfect! Not only are they good for this purpose, they are amazing for studying! I highly recommend these!"
I haven't been able to wear the dress as the arms and chest are way too small. I am in the process of losing some weight though and I am hoping to get into the dress before warm weather is gone.
"This is a nice, neat wallet - not too big.  The only think I would have like to make it an excellent wallet would be a place to hold a checkbook - other than that I am very pleased"
"My kid loves it!  Safe product, and saves water as I'm only using 1/3 as much water as I would using the full size tub for my child. Been using for several months and haven't had to refill it with air either."
"Came quickly and were as described. They were smaller than I expected, but then again the dimensions are listed in the description so I can't really blame anyone but myself on that aspect. Very simple and cute. Would probably buy again."
"I needed a festive, larger envelope for my holiday cards to accommodate a newsletter, photo and craft project. These did survive the holiday mail, but they are thin and the adhesive did not keep the envelope intact. I had to secure them with tape."
These are great!  The price is great and they are nice and thin so they fit in all shoes.  I am wearing them right now and they are making a shoe with a hard soul feel much softer.  I would recommend them!
I put this in my shower and it holds even the big shampoo and conditioner containers. I cleaned the shower wall with rubbing alcohol before I attached the suction cups. Had it for a week and has not loosened or fallen. Works great!!!
"The price is good, and the toy is durable.  I have 7 dogs and we go through stuffed toys like crazy.  See who tears it up first. My dogs chew on it like a chew bone. Ethical is also a nice touch. I will purchase more."
"I did not like this product at all. The water reservoir was so difficult to remove, I returned it and ordered a Murpho steam straightener that I fell in love with. Im glad it worked for most of you, but it was not something I enjoyed."
I ordered the purple dress. It is not at all the color in the photo. It came in more of a plum/color of Barney the dinosaur not the dark royal purple that it looks like. very disappointed in that.  Otherwise the material is nice.
Not good.  Over hyped.  Pad that came with it was to small to do anything.  Water did not stay warm long enough.  Company was awful to deal with.  Definitely not worth it.  Had to fight to get my money back.
"The most disappointing item I bought off Amazon. It's cheap, tiny and will be completely destroyed in a week. Barely fits a toddler. The little stool slides right out from underneath the baby . This was a very disappointing purchase for the price."
I bought these for my toddler who loves puzzles and they are small and cute . The only think is that they came a bit scratch already and not sure how long they will last for before paint comes off (if it does )
"This is just what I wanted - a small little calendar to keep in my bathroom. It could also be used in a purse, but I wanted something to record my weight, so I have it in a bathroom drawer. It's cute, no frills, and doesn't cost much. Perfect."
Only drawback is that if I use folded while on recliner I have to add a pillow under so the leg frame doesn't bother.  But I still gave a 5 star because it's not intended to be used folded and directly on lap.
"I've used Ammens Power for most of my life of 72 years & found it to be a great product; very excellent product for babies, kids & adults.  Glad I'm still able to locate it; no stores in my area carry it.  Good shopping experience! Thanks!"
"These have a triangular cross-section for people who can use the dynamic tripod grip. They are uncomfortable for those of us who use other grips. I have coordination problems, can't control the dynamic grips, and rely on a lateral quadrupod grip, tucking the pencil or pen under my thumb."
"These are definitely not scratch resistant! To make the claim these are safety classes automatically implies the lenses are strong. The entire surface of both lenses scatched so badly with the first cleaning with a soft rag, clearly seeing through them was impossible. Avoid this item."
Great little journal that I take on trips.  Doesn't take up much room thanks to it's smaller size.  The bookmarks are handy to keep you on the page you left off.  Paper is good quality and lined.
"I wasn't sure how my dogs would react to the taste of this, but no problem at all.  It comes with a handy scoop for easy measuring.  So much easier than trying to give my dogs a pill!  I have already notice a difference in their coat."
I have had health issues for the last few years and I needed to add healthy products into my diet. I have been drinking some different mushrooms in with my daily smoothies and I have noticed a huge difference in how I feel.
"This is a great product and will let you cut paper to nearly 16 inches (not 18).Just watch for the screws under the blade... they are sometimes missing nuts and can block the blade.  Other than that, it is the best cutter I have found."
Does the job.  Wish there were more kinds to choose from that did not pout pressure on my ankles.  I have many illnesses so need to be very careful.  I shall buy these again if need be.
"These cards have a glossy finish, which I wasn't expecting, but still loved the quality and variety. They're blank on the inside, which is perfect for customized messages/pictures. And with the quantity, they'll last me for years to come! :)"
I order this always because i can't find it in the stores around here any more. My daughter loves it too and she has a thick head of hair with no body. This always gives her hair volume and makes it hold a style.
"These foam pouches are so extremely thin they tear very easily and do not protect breakables at all! Very poor quality product, do not bother buying these, they are useless if you're trying to protect breakables. Go with another brand with a thicker foam."
So far I really like this diapers. No leaks and they fit really well. Can‚Äôt beat the price either. My only concern is that some are made from thinner material and don‚Äôt look as waterproof. Hopefully they hold up well.
"Seriously amazing. It's a medium weight denim so it keeps pup warm-ish, but comfortable. The body of it is nice and long so the skirt actually reaches her butt but doesn't get in the way when she's let outside to do her thing."
I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He immediately took it out of the package and put it on his nightstand. He can't believe how it looks so real. All Star Wars - Darth Vader Fans should have one.
"These are okay. I was hoping to like them better, but I‚Äôll still keep them. Cheap material but light weight for summer. I‚Äôm a size 4 and got a medium. Fits good. A small would have been too tight on my hips I think."
The Toner Cartridge has exactly the same structure as the one from the HP manufacture but with a much lower price.  It works well with my HP LaserJet Pro M283cdw Wireless Color Printer. The ink quality is quite good as well. Happy with the purchase!
I bought it for my cat. At first he was apprehensive because of the loud scraping noise. As it corses over his coat. Now he's over it. After A few minutes brushing he's almost comatose.But comb on the backside of the brush is pretty useless. For anything.
These pens are just what my daughter needed for her Japanese writing. They are very fine point and allow her to write her letters flawlessly. She actually loves them so much she uses them for everything. They do not leak and have been working great.
Oh my god awwww! I can‚Äôt wait to give her to my daughter for Christmas! Gonna be buying some other clothes for her because of the reviews of her dress coloring her skin! So excited. She‚Äôs beautiful. Looks even cuter in person!!
"Beautiful necklace, however my engagement ring came off it twice. The frist time I was lucky enough my fiance found it in our driveway as I was detailing my car. The second simply having just finished dishes. I felt it go down my shirt."
This little Catbug is so soft and squishy! Instead of using him as a key chain I clipped him to my rearview mirror and he goes perfectly there! He always brings a smile to my face when I get into my car.ALL HAIL LORD CARBUG
"This was probably the best purchase for the money that I have made.....all 'high end winders' were 500+....I am using 3 of the 4 winders in this thing, and it is working to a T and has not missed a beat"
This was a waste of money.  I found it ineffective.  If you want to drink a bunch of caffeine and not feel anymore alert than this is for you but I won‚Äôt spend my money on it again.
Item is absolutely nothing like the depictions. What you receive is a cheap crappy rectangular cage with flat grill in it and no divider to separate multiple mothers. It does not have a bottom section that appears to be removable. Completely false advertisement.
"First puzzle I have just given up on. Either the picture on the box is very inaccurate or I am going blind. As usual I started with edge pieces but after looking and looking for something, anything, anywhere in the puzzle that matched them, I gave up."
"Not what I was expecting, most of the reviews were good so I thought I'd try it. It's not very big, I thought it would have been more roomy. Very fake feeling and the metals were all different colors. I returned it for a refund."
"I got this for our cat who loves his stuffed snakey a little too much, thinking I could replace that nasty thing. He's scared of this toy. When I fling it towards him, he runs away.  The head of the snake is a bit heavy. Maybe that's the problem."
The toothbrush does not light up as shown in the pics. Only a green light indicator above each mode tells you which one is selected. The modes are on the handle but they aren‚Äôt illuminated. Brush heads are soft and it really just has a strong vibration but that‚Äôs it.
Installed this in our kitchen pantry.  The grey fit in with the grey of cabinet color.  Hung well though I added small mirror mounts at the bottom corners to keep it steady.  That works well.  A good product.
"Pros: This set contains just about every size cleaning brush you could possibly need to clean your combs, razors and trimmers. They're incredibly easy to clean, too. Cons: I cannot think of anything negative to say about this kit. Love it!"
"This is just the basic Staedtler sharpener with black and yellow decals affixed, which is not on par with this company's other fine offerings.It sharpens well, an keeps the shreddings and  lead dust sealed up, so there's no problem here with functionality."
Well made sheet with ample room for high withers and padded to each side of wither. The extended neck keeps the chest and shoulders dry in the rain. Well made with both buckle and snap closures at the chest. High quality overall.
"Six pads for 10 bux?  Great deal.  So far, no problems with pad coming loose from magnetic back.  I had previously bought same type of pad at a stationery store... the back did come off... then again, 15 seconds and some super glue put it right back."
Prefect for crickets and easy to use. The tubes are helpful because the crickets hang out in them and you just pull out the tube and shake the tube into the cage to get the crickets to fall out. You dont even have to touch them.
"I bought this for my husband to cure his dandruff, as I read some people have had success with this method.  It works!  It's non-irritating, and his hair is nice and shiny (bonus).  Very satisfied with this product!"
These little boots were the perfect pair for my frenchie. I was worried about the size when I ordered but followed their recommendation and they fit perfect. You do really have to tighten these to keep them on your pups feet.
"This cartridge would not work with my printer as advertised. Printed out the label and sent back by UPS and was refunded. NOW, I have been charged again for a cartridge that I do not have. Don't EVER, EVER!!! order from this vendor. It is a scam."
"These are so cute and really nice size, I was worried they‚Äôd come smaller than I was expecting. But they‚Äôre nice and good quality! Only thing is I wish they were as bright colored as they show on the photos. They‚Äôre a little dull looking."
"When I read the description, I expected the stars around the borders to have some sort of definition, like a shimmery effect. But all of the stars are a bit pale, almost ""old"" looking. Just flat colors on thin paper. I don't  recommend."
I have the whole bentgo set but wanted a back up tray to put one in the dishwasher. Happy that the extra tray is offered. Unfortunately mine was cracked when it arrived so sent it back and only green was available. But my daughter doesn't seem to mind!
"The material was comfy, packaging was nice, colors pretty, style is lovely, it fit around my chest nicely, but not around my waist, it was too big. I ordered a medium, I'm 5'1 and about 120lbs, my chest is big so maybe try a size smaller than you're usual."
"They were difficult to line up and maintain when getting them in the ears due to the fact that they were not anchored in on either side. Less than 3 weeks later, they were broken off and in the trash."
"It's a very light bag. My 6lb pom fits perfectly in it, but i dont love the way the zipper opens at top amd i don't love that the flaps on the ends do not button up easily.  It also arrives with a really strong plastic/glue smell."
I love this product for my rabbits but I would highly suggest putting some type of bedding under them because it make my cage really mildewing just in a week and had to throw them out from my rabbits peeing on them.
I am a child care provider and this was a great purchase and I especially liked the kids in the wheel chair! Please  make more sets sets with kids with disabilities!  It created excitement  and questions with the children! Bravo!!!
The buckles that keep this held up around the head rests aren‚Äôt strong enough and keep slipping which makes the whole thing loose. I attempted to return and was out of the time frame unfortunately. I do not recommend this product for heavier dogs.
My only disappointment in this dress is that it is dry clean only.  I wish it were simpler to maintain. I don't have a picture with the best angle but I attached a photo so you can have an idea of how it fit me.
"My cockatiels love their corner perch. Got the size small. I've noticed that they really like resting in the corners of their cage, so installing a corner perch has been one of the best home improvements yet. Two cockatiels can fit on here easily (when they feel like sharing)."
"I bought this as a birthday gift for my husband. We are a game playing family. We played it the first night he opened it.It is a different version of catan, but it is the same concept. We love this game and love playing it"
This was the perfect heating pad for arthritis in my neck and shoulder. It is soft and conforms easily to the affected area. It snaps in the front so my hands are free‚Äî I don‚Äôt have to hold it in place or keep adjusting it. Very happy with this purchase
This is a simple wooden toy that‚Äôs well made and very cute. Great for imaginative play. There is a spring inside the truck so when the people are pushed down they bounce up a little. We purchased this for my friends little boy who turned one.
Does not have a business card holder as described and will not fit in my file box.  Kept them as I do not have time to return.  I will just need to  figure out a way to store them besides the file box as planned.
Yes i needed to get leftover ink from my pen...  i like my pen!!!  But worked like a charm.  Guess not usually a normal reason but the hole is too small for anything else and this worked like a charm.  Thank you!!
This collar is very cool and made from sturdy material but the buckle is far too big. As a result the collar looks ridiculous on smaller dogs (I have a dachshund). Ended up giving it away to a medium sized dog.
"I have had a base unit and 1 slave for the VTECH DS6151 in my office for a year.  Adding the second slave for my staff was seamless.  Charge the unit, and in 20 seconds the new handset was paired with the base unit.  Highly recommend."
"This was a gift for someone so I‚Äôm not sure how to review the actual pieces, but it came in what looked like it had previously been  a woman‚Äôs jewelry pouch or something & was packaged very small. Hopefully the dominos themselves looked nice once fully opened."
"I was looking for a cat tree for my cats to lay on and look outside, but did not break the bank. This tree is perfect! They are both on it daily and it is very sturdy and durable. They really like to hide in the cat house as well!"
"I  use this quite often, as a way to help my neck seat in a proper position. I do a lot of surfing where my neck muscles tense up and change my body posture. This is a very good  product."
This stuff works .. we use it as a bathroom spray. I'm sensitive to scents because of my allergies and this doesn't affect me negativity at all. I bought mine at Ralph's for $4.99 though. Not sure why it is so expensive here..
"This is really cute with bright, vibrant colors. Has the disk in he bottom to help you tell if the bath temp is just right. I already had the Hippo one, but this was just so cute I couldn't resist!"
The pill crushed set is great.  I bought it for my mom who can't swallow big pills. The splitter i use for her right now.  Haven't tried the pill crushed yet.  Will post something when I do
I have spent a lot of money on pain patches and pain cream and most if they helped at all didn‚Äôt last long.These last up to 24 hours most of the time. I highly recommend them. They don‚Äôt cost much at all.Works for my Peripheral neuropathy and arthritis pain.
"The pens are very pretty but once you use them they start to leak.  Ruined a backpack already!!  We bought them for our daughter for school and she was very excited however, it didn't really work out well."
This has been great for my son and he always comes back to play with them. They are all different 'textures' so some are soft and some are hard plastic. The top one screws on which is nice to hold them all together.
Super cute pin! Bigger then i realized. Had most of my thyroid removed at 14 years old due to cysts. Its nice to have my thyroid back hahaha. I think ill name him Jeff. Cant wait to wear him on my work lanyard with my name tag.
Nice. I ordered the size L fit me perfect. I'm 5'7&#34; 198lbs. It covers my backside and I have wide hips and It closes if I wnt to wear it closed. When open it hangs perfect. I will be ordering more colors of this brand
"I‚Äôm not happy with this product, as soon as I start getting to my kittens they start vomiting, at the beginning I thought it was the food but they eat the same. My kittens have around 5 months. So I stopped. No happy."
Just as great as the zombie dog add on.IMO not to be used unless the zombie dogs are used too.Too many dog companions can break the game and make it too easy unless you balance it out.Still is a great buy.
"One of my most favorite purchases. I bought this one in brown, the ordered the black one as well. Super soft leather, really nicely made, perfect size, can carry a cell phone (G5), powder, pen, small wallet. It's roomy for a small wristlet. I HIGHLY recomment this wristlet."
"The material is thicker than a tee but not bulky like a sweatshirt. It's soft yet sturdy and a good weight for cooler weather.  I like that it's cotton so doesn't get static, and the fit is relaxed and comfortable. Thinking of getting another color!"
My dog absolutely loves these streets but I found them much cheaper in another store even less than half the price so the price on these are much too high if you hopefully bring the price down I will order them online that has a this time it's too expensive
Pretty basic notbookes. A tad bit smaller than I thought they were going to be but still worked for what I needed them for. They would be good to gift to those that like to doodle due to the plan front and back.
"This is one of the best deals I found on Amazon...Really high Quality. Perfect for that cold rainy/snowy day and want to still look your best. Runs a bit large for me, but if I should wear a suit coat underneath im sure its about right."
I love the ultra fine tips on these and the way they don‚Äôt soak through back of paper. Currently using them on an art project and are working well. There are a few duplicate colors in the set however. I would buy again!
"These costumes fit perfectly on my 10 and 12 lb cats. Were they a fan of them? Of course not, but they tolerated it long enough to get some cute pics, which is all that matters. They stayed on pretty well until they started to paw them off."
"I bought the cap as a gift. The cap design is a great idea. The cap material is not so great, very flimsy and thin. Based on the pricing, you would expect that cap would be made of better material. I think the price is not justified for the quality."
"I was so excited about this as first, it looked amazing right after printing but the day after the black color will start to change as I showed in the second picture, it‚Äôs also sticky and I don‚Äôt like that so I will not buy again."
"This Cossac Planner is a great journal event calendar to keep up with your monthly, and daily plans. It has a lot of space to write the things you have accomplished need still to accomplish and what happened in the aftermath. It‚Äôs really a great product."
"Case is fine and seems good quaility, but it is way too big for the Emay ECG machine.  Technically the machine fits, but it is very loose inside it.  I wish I had compare different it in more detail to the emay branded one which is smaller"
"Based on the people in the photo of the product it is smaller in size than the actual product; banner, holes in banner, bean bags.  Based on the photo on Amazon product is cheaper and thinner; transparent, see through."
"I love this top and loved it when I saw it. I am normally a size medium, but I ordered a large and it fits perfectly. I'm 5''5 and it's long enough to wear with leggings. If you're going to order this I would definitely go with a size larger."
"I work at an airport and since being ordered to work from home, I miss seeing planes!  These paper clips are not only representative of what I miss but, they do a great job with holding multiple documents together."
So I purchased this product for my wife and I wanted to get her taken care of so I ordered it. It arrived promptly and pictures don't do it justice as its a beautiful piece of work. My wife says it works beautifully and asked happy so I'm happy
"Color sorting, patterning with one, two, three, four, five, or six colors, counting, and the list goes on and on; that is what makes this the perfect gift for toddlers.  Also, the work with fine motor coordination is excellent."
"I was very pleased. The watch is surprisingly sturdy, detailed, and has an elaborate design and inscription of &#34;In Hoc Signo Vinces&#34; on the back. The pen is very sturdy, and also very detailed. I would recommend these items as gifts for any lodge brethren.  SMIB."
I did not receive the metal frame that was supposed to come with this gift. This was a gift & I did not receive it In the 30 day window.  You need to send me the rest of the watch!!‚Äô
"I love it. I bought it with the Black Friday discount and I'm really happy with it. I gave it to my nephew as Christmas gift and it's so much fun. Nice package, you can bring it with you wherever you go easily"
the strap that goes across the back would be better suited for a wider width dog such as a bulldog so i ended having to sew the strap shorter to fit my pug. it does work great for keeping her from chewing on her legs
"UGLY CHEAP, LOOKS LIKE PLASTIC, GET BETER STUFF FROM GUM BALL MACHINES..I WOULDNT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN. EVERYTHING I GOT FROM THEM IS JUNK AND IM STUCK WITH IT BECAUSE IT COSTS MORE TO SEND IT BACK. I THINK THIS IS WHAT THIS COMPANY IS HOPING FOR."
"Wow! I save a huge amount of money on this purchase. I love compatible cartridges because I save money. It came as advertised and I put it in my Samsung Laser printer, and I am in business. I would purchase these again from this seller.Happy Customer"
But this every year. Need to be careful there is a product on line in amazon that is a copy. Looks exactly the same on the outside The pages are different. Lines smaller Print lighter Not at all like this one
Today is my hubs birthday. I gave him this card when he was leaving the house for work so he can open it alone without the kids being around LOL....he texted me a couple hours later saying this was the best birthday he ever got from me lol!
It was cute but not the one I ordered. Owl had yellow nose and feet instead of orange and also had gray stitching instead of the white. The blue color of the owl isn‚Äôt the same as in the picture either
"These were great to wear during the turkey trot! I was surprised not many people, of the 2000+ participants, dressed for the occasion so my sister and I stood out (which was great!).My only complaint‚Ä¶it took LOTS of bobby pins to keep them on our heads."
"Its a great wheel. Its still has some noise, so its not as silent as the 'silent' wheel I found. Its been great for my shy Rat though - She never used wheels before, and she has been using this one~ Its wonderful."
"This card was beautiful to my daughter and special but what was amazing was how fascinating it was to my 18 month grandson and my 30 something year old son, they both stared at it and smiled for a long time."
"I love this suit, but I couldn't get it over my chest!  So sad, it an adorable concept for a suit!  If you are small chested, this is for you!  The lace part is very flattering, even on a plus size, 7 month pregnant gal!"
"It doesn't get very hot. You have to do really small sections of hair at a time otherwise it doesn't work. Loses battery super fast.I have fine, thin hair so it works for me but I wouldn't recommend it to someone with thick or curly hair."
"I‚Äôm assuming it cannot be too difficult to sell what you advertise, but these are clearly not smiley face stickers. It‚Äôs as if it wasn‚Äôt aligned prior to printing and no one either looked before shipping or didn‚Äôt care. Pretty sad when you cannot even get simple smile face stickers."
"This puzzle is so much fun! It's a challenge without being too hard for relaxation. The pieces fit together nicely. Not so tight you are unsure if it is a fit, but enough to hold it together. Our first White Mountain Puzzle purchase and we will buy one again."
Yeah.  Getting the cloud app connected was a PITA.  I tried both android and iphone.  I tried for an hour.  Tried for an hour again.  The next day it suddenly works.  Now its 3.5 stars bumped to 4 because its been solid.
The directions are easy to follow and items look special when finished because of the embroidery. Color way is up to you - traditional or modern - will make a great addition to your table scape as well as a gift for the attendees
"I wasn't sure when I first applied the screen. I ended up with 2 rather large bubbles. I tried to work them out, but that didn't seem to be working, so I put it aside. The next day everything was perfect. No bubbles and no regrets."
It looks comfortable for my dog but he just removes it whenever we put it on him. I tried two sizes and neither worked. I think it needs one more strap to keep him from being able to remove it with his paw.
Got this today and I love it!! It writes easily and easy to figure out how to switch to pencil and the bar sticker comes off easily!! I hate it when I have to fight that sticker. I may be back for more!
"This arrived in pieces and even though I did manage to snap it back together, it didn't work.  In my opinion it's a piece of junk.  The box was old and dirty too.  It looked like it was sitting in someone's basement for years."
I gifted this to my Nephew who loves Minecraft and he was SO happy. I think this is worth the money AND it is a lot bigger than I had expected (I thought it would be the size of a Beanie Babies stuffed toy)
"Kinda easy to put together but there were  times, able to put together, despite having big hands it would have been easier it would have been easier if, I had smaller hands at times but otherwise I enjoyed putting it together every detail also is compatible with Lego"
Writes through dirt and grime. We use them to sign off on exterior log sheets and rodent station monitoring placards that are exposed to the elements. Goes great with the rite in the rain notepads. The ink is holds up for years in the elements.
This is exactly what I need for parties and events. It does not take up a lot of space while holding and lot of ballots. I love that I can add a sign to it so everything is contained along with the blank ballots on the side.
I bought it to give as a gift but it doesnt look as pretty as the picture. It's still nice but not as nice so I had to buy somwthing else for the gift since I didn't feel it was impressive enough on it's own.
"We have tried many underground dog fence wires over the years. Unfortunately, they usually reach an early demise with a shovel. This wire is a definite upgrade to the thinner gauge wires, and the insulation thickness appears to be good. [Will not prevent shovel damage, though] :)"
"Had reserved hopes for these with the relatively low price, was expecting to need to supplement with more but pleasantly surprised. Moving up to a 55 gallon tank and combined with some other stuff, these will be a great addition to my new tank."
My Puppy had lodt his hair on his bavk and was bitinghimself all the time. My Vet actually told me about this pruduct and it cleared up his back fast. He stopped itching and gave his hair time to grow back.
"Even at the largest size, the cups for the top are at my neck. I am not a very large woman, I'm 5'6&#34;, 165 lbs and I couldn't get this on. Material is very scratchy and uncomfortable. Not even worth paying to return. üòî"
I really like these but the last two times I‚Äôve bought them one of them in the set comes broken/not functioning. The company is good about sending you a replacement if they get lost in the mail though. And when they do work they‚Äôre great.
This item was bought as a goody bag gift. It did not last. It lights and works. Some stayed lit and won‚Äôt turn off. It easily broke and won‚Äôt go back in place. Doesn‚Äôt last too long with the kiddos.
The dress fit well enough for a $40 dress but the green was not as pictured. I was hoping it was the bluish-green in the photo but it was more of a forest green. If the color was what I was looking for I probably would have kept it.
"The problem with this product is that it's very squeaky. It squeaks so loud with every movement. However, it's still worth it to me, because it feels so good. I've got my friends hooked; many of them bought one after they tried mine."
Love the color and the fleece inside. Good for weather 30+. Anything below 30 you should try a different glove. I brought the xl. I have big hands. From the base of my palm to the tip of my middle finger is about 19.5 cm. They fit perfectly.
These are great socks that stay in place during yoga practice.  So many others slip off my small toes when in standing poses.  These socks stay on and have wonderful traction on the mat making warrior poses more stable.  Thank you.
I use this product for me PowerPoint presentations while I am instructing music. This allows me to have my hands continually free while using my foot pedal to forward each slide. I have had excellent results and would recommend it.
"This my 3rd one, purchased 2 during lock down for our 2 grandkids,  now #3 for our #3, cause he wanted 1. They work great on our property and the kids get to feed the cows with them, hauling hay in the trailer."
"Crown is made for a child for a VERY small head.  I am disappointed that my daughter will not be able to wear it.  I wish I could return it, but she already ripped it out of the package."
I was surprised that my puzzle arrived with more Chinese writing than English. I had no idea it was coming from China and would not have ordered it had I known.  I could return it but would probably spend as much as I paid for the puzzle itself.
"I got two of these for my kids and I am SO impressed!  I have an expensive ""sonic toothbrush"" that doesn't have nearly the amount of features this does and doesn't come with 8 replacement heads like this one did.  I'm SO glad I picked these toothbrushes."
"The walnut in the box is not quite as well figured as the ad, but it's decent walnut and reasonably well made for its intended purpose.  It is a good value for the money, and I recommend  it."
I was actually quite surprised as how well this fit and the length. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 so definitely petite but usually wear a large so I ordered the large and it fit soo good. Usually dresses that come in large are long on me but this one was just right.
"I bought a few lanyards for my kids masks to go to school and everywhere . These are the best for the safety open on the back and for the length , it is just right, not too short not too long. School supply must have nowadays ."
This product is unusable in many fish tanks since the plastic parts with the suction cups cannot be adjusted to the size of your tank.  I would not recommend buying this unless you know the measurements of the divider and your fish tank.
I paid more than the others on Amazon as I expected a better quality made prank. It looked good initially but as soon as it got wet the paint ran all over it and stained the sleeve. Now it looks like a big mess. Garbage......
"My card came with the envelope badly creased and the card bent at the one third marking. I wrote to seller but no response. Otherwise the card is beautiful, outstandingly elegant.  Not the customer service though.  Wouldn‚Äôt have enough time to return and reorder."
I was taking environmental class that is required to keep a journal. I thought this would be a cute journal for this project as it has the compass on it. I did drop this class and decided to use it for taking notes
"I have tried many different ball of foot pads, this is the best hands down.  They stay in place and offer good cushioning. They are not that spongy vinyl that make your feet sweat and your foot won't stick to it if you aren't wearing stockings."
I ordered this box of EUVIVI Eco Solvent Ink to use in my new Epson ET2803.  All four bottles are full and securely wrapped. Also included are 4 syringes but only 3 needles. There are no instructions included and no information on how to contact EUVIVI for help.
The filer is great! It wasn‚Äôt hard to place onto my wall at all. And it holds all of my folders and papers onto the wall with sturdiness and it doesn‚Äôt move 10/10! I think this is great for people who need to keep paper files in person.
"Purchased these for my 6 year old and she loves them! She is small, about 40 ish pounds  it is able to use them well. My other kids have fun with them, too ages 7, and 13! Very durable."
"the fabric sucks, and it leaves you looking like your headlights are on but its just because the stitch all meets at the nipple area. also, not very supportive and not very aligned either.. the worst bra i have ever bought"
It looks sooo cute on! I bought his for my cruise and liked it so much that I left this one on for the whole trip :) because it is a cheapish metal it does wear out and look sort of dull fairly quickly. I would definitely buy another one!
"[[VIDEOID:c86737edb47c0b2802da49fe81d8f028]] This is perfect except it doesn‚Äôt lock in place and as soon as I go to type, it wants to slide back in. I have to keep pressure underneath with my leg so I can type. Wish it locked into place."
"I got this for my micro pig, he throws is around more than he eats it. I have a friend that has horses, I just buy a flake from her every once in a while instead of paying for this and its shipping."
"It‚Äôs OK, but needs improvement.The nuts where it tightens the metal clip is in the way of the charger port. Also, there is no way to disconnect the collar from the  box to wash it. Mine look so gross already."
"I don‚Äôt understand the good reviews about this product, this is smaller version of what you would get from your local hardware store. The colors aren‚Äôt even bright like the pictures, the red is more like orange red. I will return this product."
Adorable. I got this as a present for my 2 year old niece. I like that it‚Äôs machine washable. The story of Goldie on the tag is very short and to the point so I plan on buying a book to go with this present.
"I found that while it was very absorbent on top, it was not super waterproof on the bottom and it seeped through.  I have a tiny dog and this was an issue so I am sure it would be a bigger issue with a larger dog."
Every time I use this on my back it feels so great!Just a couple of rolls and I feel everything crack. I feel a difference in breathing too!I just wish it was slightly bigger but it‚Äôs still good to use.
This is a very thin book with very little pages. There were only eight note pages that are at the very back of the book so there's not even enough for every month of the year. Should be note pages in each month slot as well.
Ordered because they were very cheap ion pen refills. You get what u pay for in this case. I now own 10 cartridges which fit poorly. Ink skips. None of the smooth writing you expect from a gel pen. Do not buy.
"This shirt fits me perfectly and is a gorgeous shade of muted apricot. Looks so good with rose gold jewelry. The off the shoulder top is a pain to wear, period and this one is no different. But the compliments were worth it!"
"When replacing the cover of the battery slot one of the prongs that hold it in place broke. It still stays shut with a little tape. It is effective in stopping our loud-month precious little one, a terrier, from barking."
"Well made, a little large for average horse. At first I liked the vacuum packaging but then had to stuff the mask and leave it out in the heat to get the wrinkles to relax so it wouldn't rub the horse's eyes."
These labels look very nice and I was really happy with them until I needed to remove one. They absolutely do not come off of plastic storage containers. Very very disappointed in that fact. My containers that I needed to change the label on look horrible now.
"Ordered these to accommodate our wedding invitations and I was more than pleased! Love the color and the flap was the euro style I was searching for, in order to add a little touch of elegance. I used a gold, opaque brush pen to address and they turned out beautifully!"
"I did not find this product to be very effective for me.  It left my skin looking very lack luster and normally I have a good, healthy glow.  I switched to Olay Regenerist and have been getting much better results."
"It does straighten my back, which is great, but after a while the side straps dig into the skin. I wanted to be able to wear It during the work day but after a certain point the material was scratchy and digging into my skin and it wasn‚Äôt even tight."
"Recieve this as described....1500 pieces! Very vibrant colors and the pieces are very well cut! There was ZERO puzzle dust when I emptied the package which was awesome. The edges actually are distinct edges, unlike some super hard puzzles I've done."
"This product is made well. It has been keeping up in the yard with my 5 y/o putting in dirt, sand, mud, cars, and toys. It falls over quite a bit, but other than that it serves it purpose and is worth the price."
"Very effective, love the ultra high potency. I have slow digestion problems from a chronic disease . I have been using Triphala for years , which helps significantly, and quickly This is the highest quality brand I have found, definitely will repurchase this product."
"This display replica is an ideal gift for the Star Wars fan. The quality of the paint and finish is high - looks great on my bookshelf.Too fragile to ""play with""  - also smaller in size than I expected."
"I was somewhat shocked when this arrived, and there was very little iodine in it. This is an extremely important vitamin for the thyroid. The fact that is skimped on is extremely telling of the quality of the vitamin, in my thought. Buyer beware."
"This ring is great. I‚Äôm very active and have no problems wearing this ring while at the gym, running and cycling It‚Äôs so comfortable, I forget I have it on. It doesn‚Äôt fall off when I wash my hands either."
"Refuses to stay up. So basically the one suction cup that does stay up just makes this a small bit of climbing wall area. They seem to dig it, so I left it in there. But it's not what I got it for."
"Great price and quality! Had several similar ones before with the braided leather. Longer than standard, which is really nice.  Once you break in the leather (kinda stiff when new), they are really nice. Classy, much better than the shoestring looking things....."
Came with zero directions reached out to seller never got any response. Not sure how much to use? if you‚Äôre supposed to dilute? If you should keep it on a certain time? Didn‚Äôt particularly clean or improve my leather seats either.
I got the 2XL. A little large but I still love it!!! I wear medium or large in US size. Price is killer deal. I love the design. A few fake buttons you can do without. Might remove the hood and buttons. Still cool as hell!!!
"Best bra I have ever bought. NO underwire but supports well. But, the best thing about this bra is the support on the sides. No digging, no rolling, just support so undetectable I had to keep checking I was wearing one!"
This cover is so perfect for my car and dog! It also puts up a little barrier between the front and back seat. I love that it connects to both the front and back headrests. It keeps the cover in place nicely.
"Good quality - my only issue is that after several sprays, the product leaks and runs down the side of the bottle and on my hands.  I'm going to use them and keep an old towel or cloth nearby."
"The bottle portion of the set was not effective in regards to water flow. Had to continually squeeze to put water in which resulted in spilling. If I could, I would return item but it took me awhile before I opened up the package and setup for Mr. P."
it‚Äôs raining/ hurricane here in Florida and my fur baby needs coverage when we go outside. This coat is so cute and fits my fur baby perfectly. He looks so cute and now he can stay dry when we go for walks when it rains. I definitely recommend
I bought this brace for a friend who is having shoulder pain following a dislocation.  I thought it was a good value and fit for the price point.  I would recommend this brace to anyone who needs one.
"I bought these according to the size chart.  Loved how it fit, once I got it on, but had a heck of time getting it off.  I would suggest going up a size so you can get it off."
"Wasn't looking for the absolute best quality, I have better cuticle cutters, but this served the purpose of just putting clippers everywhere so I'm not looking for clippers for 30 minutes. They're not terrible, and for the price, it's perfect for what I needed."
I really really REALLY love the material and the stretchiness! The pajamas are so comfortable and the fabric feels great! This was a great purchase and I will be ordering more. My daughter wants some also! I ordered a size medium.
"Got this for a gift, my only issue is that it's no in a box but just a ""netting"" like buying a bag of onions. Oh well, but otherwise, its okay and I think recipient will have fun with toy."
"I tried using regular pee pads folded up and the urine soaked through to the plastic. With the pads designed to fit the litter box, the pad absorbs the urine and you don't smell it. They are great to use with the crystal litter."
"The trash  bags hold the trash... Not much else left to say. Since only house-hold discards‚Äî ie junk mail, weekly rural advertisements, old magazines, etc‚Äîare thrown into the bags, I can‚Äôt speak for how the bags hold up with heavier substances."
"These are GREAT! My cats think they are dangerous but they'll get use to them. They are sturdy, look great, can be assembled for whatever direction is needed, and fill gaps in traveling paths on the wall. VERY well built and feel solid. I love these steps."
"These are not sturdy as described in the description.  They are very thin, as in thinner than a regular piece of paper.  The colors are pretty, but I couldn't sue them for the purpose intended.  I would not repurchase."
Tired of these worthless products from China with all the false advertising!!!! Not VINYL‚Ä¶but PAPER!!! Not 3D!!!  DON NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID!!!  AMAZON DO BETTER!!! STOP LETTING CHINA RIP US OFF!!! I‚Äôll get what I need for this product from Hobby Lobby!!
This printer prints out very well also it‚Äôs easy to clean up after used. The only issue I have is the waffle paper sucks üò° they could have chosen a more quality style of paper or now at all .
This is a good set of small staplers. They are handy and work well. The set includes the needed accessories including staples and staple removers. The blue color is bright and cheery. Easy to use this set is great for kids and classes.
"These scissors are great for the dog, nice and sharp and he doesn't hardly flinch now when I want to clip his hair around his eyes.  With dull scissors before he did not like it, they hurt him, these are super good and safe with round edge."
"[[VIDEOID:cdabcecef63a52219c011c5e7aed1b4a]] Cute but small and thin. Possibly best for a puppy or small dog. Nice hood with snaps to hold in place to keep a small puppy, or even human, warm while air-drying.Packaged nice enough for gifting.Made in China.I hope you find this review helpful."
"Brought this for my 16 month, musical grandson. I was leery. He was as interested in opening the lid as he was playing it. The sound is surprisingly nice. The options are numerous.  It's  a perfect balance of musical and toy."
"Not the best quality, and not the most sturdy, but it's functional and works well for smaller dogs in the 15 lb or less range. It's kind of like a plastic bag with a stand. Much better than the kitchen sink. I'm keeping it assembled and outside on my patio."
"Pros:  cute kitties, all but two pieces included, easy design, cheap priceCons: no instructions so had to use product photos to construct, pieces different colors than picture (fences white instead of brown, different flower colors, different shaped  cats), baseplate a bit warped"
"Stay fresh all day. Easy to use and smells fresh. it is a little expensive with the shipping, compare what it costs in the store overseas but well worth the money. For me, it works great. It ships fast, so regular shipping works great."
These binders have been very helpful for us.  My daughter is quiet rough on her school supplies and we are constantly replacing them.  She has had these for over half of last year and still using this year.
My Affenpinscher is almost 5lbs and he fits perfectly in the Medium.  He really likes it.  We go for 2 mile walks with the other dogs and his tiny legs can't keep up so this makes it easy to carry him.
These are THE cutest things ever!  I bought these for myself and my daughter decided she needed them.  She never takes them out and are very comfortable to sleep in.  I will purchase a pair for myself soon.
"Assembling these as intended resulted in tearing and ripping.  When ribbon was put on they tore even more making them difficult to fill.  If it wasn‚Äôt for using a rolling pin and tape, the bulk of them would not have been usable."
"I have 3 puppies under 1yr old, they will Wrestle and Bite on each other's Collars. I've had the replace previous tags about 3 times because 1 or the other choose it apart.Purchase this about 6 months ago, they've been Wrestling  chewing and Still looks great!"
"This car is much fun than all toy cars my kids had ever before. It can cross many terrains and barriers, rotate in place, easy to control, also the looking is cool, it took more fun than any other remote cars, my boys love it so much!"
These are crap! I spent time writing all my Christmas cards only to find that the ENVELOPES HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO GLUE ON THEM WHATSOEVER!!!!Really?? Am I supposed to tape the envelopes shut?? How tacky!So no one gets a Christmas card.Merry frigging Christmas.
"All my yorkies have had the worst problems with tartar and hate having their teeth brushed.  I still brush my dog's teeth daily, and I apply the gel once a week, and it's a great help in reducing the speed of the tartar buildup!"
"I love this dress, too cute. It has a little stretch to it, so it fits very well. Looks great on me. The print is beautiful. I am 5'4&#34;, size L normally and I ordered 10/12, I'm top-heavy, but the stretch everything fits perfectly."
This is not the sellers fault though.  Life Essentials change the design of their plastic bottles.  It is very irritating waiting for an eye drop that doesn't come.  What's wrong with the old bottle design?  Now you need to find something to puncture the tip.
All five of these were damaged - plastic film was wrinkled on fold scene making it something I did not want to gift.  Did not realize the was the case until I gave to granddaughter and opened it with her to play with.
"I previously owned the 105.  I upgraded to a larger tank and needed a better filter, so I purchased the 305.  The step by step instruction video was helpful.  My tank looks so much better now that I have the appropriate filter in place."
"Small, and doesn't hold the weapons well.  Toy is poorly made, not a good product.  Seller is great.  Shipped on time and received product in short period of time.  Rating is for the product and not for the seller."
"This product is not good quality. Black rubber pieces broke off and were floating in my testosterone. This happened with 2 syringes and a vial of testosterone was ruined in the process. It's cheap, not a smooth pull, and not safe."
"Looks cute but its too small. There are ledges on the inside that get coated in pee, the pee runs down the ledges and goes to the bottom where it sits under the tray. I wanted to love it but now it just stinks"
My almost 13 year old daughter wanted swim shorts for this summer.  She still wears a girls 16 so I took a chance on the womans small and they fit her real nice.  She is thrilled and the shorts are super cute!
"These are great. We bought them for the office and they are sturdy and easy to use and flexible. The only issue is hanging 2 parkas side by side in the winter can be a challenge, so you may want to get two if you're planning on sharing with someone."
I‚Äôve had this feeder for a few months and it‚Äôs ALWAYS a PITA to connect it to my wifi!!It just beeps and flashes but the stupid app won‚Äôt connect it to WIFI! How can I return this since I no longer have to box for it?
I bought these to donate to a dog rescue I volunteer with.  At first glance they are very thin and I was unimpressed - but they seem to be holding up.  We only use them with our calmer/less hyper pups because they just don't feel exceptionally strong.
These are light weight and easy to put on and take off. I wear them when I exercise and they do seem to help prevent my knee pain. I would recommend them for anyone experiencing knee discomfort. Hey it beats having to taking pills all the time.
"Took a couple of weeks to get, but I was not in a hurry.  I had purchased the blue one as well for another baby shower and it was a total hit.  Can't beat the price or quality"
"Although our dogs hate having things done to their ears (except a good ear rub!), they were so much less scratchy after we used these on them! The ingredients are great, mild & effective. We're all really happy with these!"
"Great belt, exactly what I was looking for.  The only thing is that I had to add more holes in the belt (which I see were other complaints).  Must have been made for a person with an 18 inch waist.  Luckily there was room to spare."
"We love these little machines. The only issue is because they are so small, you run through bubbles really quickly. The batteries also seem to die fairly easy in comparison to other toys. Other than that, they serve their purpose pretty well!"
"Used these batteries alongside Pulse of the same rating. After a month of use, these are nearly puffed into spheres. Their claims as best warranty since sliced bread was invented, it's all a scam. They don't even reply to emails."
Don‚Äôt think I will ever buy this again. The taste is not the problem. It‚Äôs the large amount of artificial color added in conjunction with the fine powder. I hate artificial colors added to health items. And the powder gets everywhere. Stains things.
"THESE ARE NOT IN A BOOK.  Useless to me, please change your picture that does not show actual product.  They are not numbered.  The only accurate part about these is the white, canary and pink colors.  Frustrating!!"
We have some Catan obsessed family members and I‚Äôm very excited to gift this to their son this Christmas so he can start learning/playing as well! It is very similar to the original game but more simple for younger ones.
False advertising on this one. Watch out for 3rd party sellers like in this case who create their own listing page and then falsely advertise. It's become the wild west on Amazon and now feels like a gamble on whether you're getting what a listing claims.
I‚Äôve bought several packages. My beautiful golden retriever loves these. After his last potty break he gets two pieces & looks up at me asking for one more. Sometimes he wins & sometimes mom wins. Great price & delivered. Win for pup & win for mom.
"Great performing life jacket... however, better instructions for fitting...my dog is had her skin rubbed wrong that is benched for a few days now.  My 47lbs dog was able to keep her head above water.  It performed well in high 5&#34; surf, and 5 knot fast moving streams."
"Well if you‚Äôre hoping for an equal mix this isn‚Äôt it. See picture for what I got. It was mostly clear beads. I can use this for my purposes which is why I‚Äôm not returning it, but it doesn‚Äôt seem worth the money."
"We love these and they are adorable. We bought two sets to practice words, however, the magnets scratch the fridge and we will not be able to use them as intended, I will have to buy a cookie sheet or something to prevent further damage. :-("
"great product...I always have had a yo-yo weight problem and these thingys make it so I dont have to buy new pants as often,,,also...I carry one with me all the time for times when I eat a little too much and my pants become too tight"
"There is nothing like a poodle calendar to perk you up every day that you look at it.  Calendar is top quality, great photographs, including one who is the exact image of my own poodle.  Service was very good and I am well pleased."
Purchased this purifier planning on using the essential oils tray. We are beyond pleased with the way it works. We are using it in a bedroom and it is working perfectly. Would not hesitate in buying this again. The shipping was super fast too.
"If I have to wear a face covering in this day and age, might as well be this. I like the fact that this cover is a bit roomier than others that I have. The weathered flag pattern is pretty cool as well."
"They look great but after the 2nd sip, they start to soften and wilt, eventually turning to mush, making it impossible to drink through.  I wanted to go more eco friendly than plastic but this just loses all functionality.  I'll go with metal or other re-usable material."
I actually like these a lot.  They are easy to put on and take off of my boys.  I will be ordering another set soon.  I put a posie pad in them to help keep my boys dry.
I‚Äôm loving this product great for cardio as it doesn‚Äôt give me a ‚Äúpump ‚Äú in my legs like some other products. It‚Äôs adding miles to my run and my recovery has been great. This is my new primary cardio preworkout
Product arrived after contact from previous comment posting.  Tried to remove other posting but found not.  The muzzle works great and I ordered a second one for our other dog.  I would recommend the item to others
"This item smells horrible! Also this is not what I received.  I received the one with the cow on the cover. If you are sent that one, aend it back! If I could rate less than one, I would."
"This item was very bulky & heavy, it was hard to use. It barely opened all the way, which made you use more pressure to get it to stay open & there was no ""teeth"" to pick up anything. Mine came previously owned. Noticeably used, had to send back."
"My son was a hit in this outfit! He wore it to a wedding and he looked absolutely adorable. The pants were a little big but we rolled them up and they still looked super cute.. + room to grow, yay! Worth the buy."
We needed a white board for the office. I ordered one for one associate and then I was asked for an additional for its easy use and ability to move it around. It‚Äôs a good price point too all things considered.
I sent this to my granddaughter (13).  She didn't know what it was...but now she loves it!  She plays basketball and I love the different themes of covers.  My daughter and son in law got a real kick out of it.
"The batteries work well however there is a tab that holds them in place.  The tab is just a tad smaller than the name brand and it can fall out if the dog scratches the collar, as mine does."
"Wet charcoal goes everywhere, so beware! And, it takes a lot to get it out of your teeth and gums. Even after brushing with toothpaste I had to floss twice. Have only used once so no results yet, but so far I'm not impressed."
"Received these for my son for school, they arrived in a box that was busted in half and the outer box was about 5 times too large for the box that was torn to shreds.  Thank goodness the pencils were all in tact."
"I have some great pens that require a 3.75"" long refill. I can't find those anywhere. I think they do it on purpose so you have to throw out the pain. I hate this throwaway Society. I just snip these off and it works great."
I bought these for my daughters spy themed birthday party.  Worked great for the day.  Two of the 9 year olds broke the plastic holder where the hoe attaches to the clip but I'm sure adults would manage for a day just fine.  :-)
"I have a giant fancy goldfish, he's probably bordering on being a Koi, and after many attempts of trying to find something he likes and fits into, we finally succeeded with this one. Fits perfect in a 29 gallon tank. Good sized openings, easy to clean. And George loves it"
"I have two 80 pound poodles I clip every month and this table makes it easier. The table does not even move when the walk around. The wire rack was flimsy and came bent, but the rest of the table is sturdy."
Bought this dog toy as a gift for a friend and they loved it so much! She is very happy and it looks great on her. The sizing was true to size and quality was nice for the price. I highly recommend for your dogs!
I bought this as a cheaper alternative to a welping box and it worked great! The top zips open for easier access to the pups. Now I use it for the puppies to sleep and play in. Honestly the best $40ish bucks i ever spent!
"Do not buy! The first time I used it the razor blade splintered into the meat my heel. I had to pick pieces of it out of my foot. Instead of a pic-me-up, I had a red, bloody bathtub and injury."
"I bought these to go with supergirl halloween costume. They are perfect in regards for that use. Very bright lights, and granddaughter loves them. I would order up a size though. The sketcher brand shoes are large on my grandchild....these barely fit and are tight."
Its an expensive product but it works. I would also like to complement the company. We originally received the wrong product and were asked to pay the return postage for this heavy product. After speaking with Provenza they very kindly and quickly sent us the correct item at their expense.
"As many reviews have mentioned, it's a scam. Only received one bottle when the listing (NOT SO CLEARLY) SAYS its' for two bottles. Who has the time for this @%$#? Nobody, and I guess they're banking on that, and that people won't return it."
"Beautiful clear green amethyst necklace.  My mother's birthstone is amethyst, and I'm going to surprise her at Christmas with something other than the usual purple gem.  I also purchased the matching earrings.  I think she'll be pleased."
I included these lego molds in my grandson's (age 7) Easter basket and he was thrilled with them. He couldn't wait to try making some Lego Gummies.  He watched a video on youtube by someone making Lego gummy pieces with similar molds.
"The size and style were great for keeping our puppy out of trouble when she goes to the office with my husband. Unfortunately, after a few rambunctious days, she bent the wall pieces and now it doesn't stand up correctly."
"This is a cute little toy.  It's well made and looks great.  The toy's voice is nice and clear.  Easy to understand.  The colors are rich and the toy seems to be fairly sturdy.  Overall, it's a nice toy."
"I was really happy for this pen, but after using it a short time it snapped in half after having been in my bag. The quality is really poor for that to have occurred. This is really disappointing because I liked how the pen wrote."
Please do not buy these. I tried to save money bc cannon ink is so expensive. This ink broke my printer. The print heads are ruined which means I need a new printer. $170 later. Yeah just pay for cannon ink.
"I have had compliments on this bracelet. It is very retro-looking. It looks like it costs many times what it did. Usually these stretch bracelets reveal the elastic btw the beads because of my larger wrists, but this one fit very well.  I am very happy with it."
"Old and nastalfic. My husband purchased fornour son‚Äôs birthday, because he had this one when he was a kid. They struggled with assembly and ended up taking to a hobby shop to have assembled for them. Ugh. Not the best on the market anymore either."
"Thank goodness for the stretch! Says its an 2XL and fits like an XL, maybe a 2XL for the guy sewing it in China! Love the style and it worked as long as I wore another shirt and coat over the top."
"This spray was horrible on my glass shower doors.  Followed the directions and the spray was very hard to get off the glass doors , in fact it was very sticky.  My shower doors looked worse then when I started."
Good but each of these has so little product in it that you think you have this and its actually empty. The product itself is very good and deserves higher praise.  Possibly a 5 star product if they put more in each &#34;pen&#34; or &#34;cartridge&#34;.
"Also, not the 2-12 inch light bars like was stated in the question and answers for this product.Does not duplicate the same LED lights that came with the Marineland 60 gallon tank as thought. Seemed as though lights were just thrown in the box."
My son is 5 and is totally into Ninjago.  We watch the show and he's got quite a few figures and the like.  This was a great deal but has increased in price over $1...it still looks like a pretty good deal.
"I‚Äôve been looking for a calendar like this for years. This is a wall calendar doesn‚Äôt take up much space and I use to manage activities, deadlines, vacations, and etc. I‚Äôm bought another one as a stocking stuffer because my sister admired mine so much."
"Ha!  Imagine my surprise when I received this and thought it was a regular mouse pad.  I love it.  I do not game and do not understand why such a mouse pad would be needed.  For me, it was a happy accident."
"Really top of the line scrub top from koi, very lightweight and comfortable, stay in place great for a FL hot weather 12hr shift made easy, it also washes well, in dryer on very low no problem, and doesn't run small for me I love these lightweight top"
"Been using pocket 2yr calendars for years.  TF Publishing make a quality calendar.  I keep it in my pocketbook and it still looks great after 2 years of use.  I find it the perfect size for noting Dr. Appointments, birthdays, etc."
I put together a weekend bag for my dog when she went to her dog sitter.  These cups are so handy and take up less room than a regular measuring cup.  An added bonus is that I can clip the extra cup to her dog food bag.
"We used this at our international food fair, and people could pin where they were from, and they loved it! The map was large enough that multiple pins could fit in each small country, and that made it really nice.Would buy again!"
"Plug it into my Windows 10 laptop and work out of the box. Also tested on Windows 7 machine and works fine, too. I'm not giving 5-star only because it has trouble scan barcode off computer screen but at this price that maybe a luxury."
"I bought the WLtoys V959 Quadcopter Parts Carbon Fiber Anti-clockwise Motor Blue and White Wires as a backup, so i haven't used it yet. I purchased one before from MECO that worked great. It is exactly the correct part. I would buy this again from MECO!"
I love this collar but wish I would have chosen a different color.  Not the best color for active dogs it is really hard to get the dirt out of the grooves and as would be expected with a bright sunshine yellow it stains quickly!
I bought it as a test and and will order again. Sticks very well especially if you are using a plastic wrap at the same time. For the price 100 stickers is a bit expensive but the product is good
"love the big pages in the coloring books. 2 year old daughter loves the sticker book, and i love that they are reusable so when she puts all of the ocean animals in the desert, i can move them around after. :)"
"I misunderstood that these bottles are plastic.  I believed they wold be frosted glass.However, they are a good size and thickness  and I will use them because I like them for something other than I'd planned to use them."
"Got this for my granddaughter for Christmas & am blown away!  I‚Äôm absolutely thrilled with this!  Minnie is the perfect size, so soft & cuddly.  Authentic Disney tags.  Now the challenge is to be able to wait until Christmas to give this to my granddaughter!"
"I have used these for one trip so far.  They seem to be sturdy and well-made.  I bought the red option to go with my luggage, and particularly like the clear top.  If needed, I would buy these again."
All Challenge Coins I purchase are of the highest quality. I buy many coins to pass out to former Marines especially WWII Marines. Keep up with the high quality of each coin and the price so I can continue buying them
Out of this hundreds of bath toys we have this ducky egg is BY FAR their FAVORITE!! I had to buy another one so both kids could have one at the same time. They literally never stop playing with them the ENTIRE bath!!!!!! DEFINITELY BUY!!!
I ordered Pippie the pumpkin pie but got Cornelias the corn. Luckily my daughter isn't too picky and liked it anyways but the pie had meaning behind it.  It's cute but just a little disappointed especially for the price paid.
"These were fine for decorating, although the pearl sheen on the white was pretty ugly. The confetti balloons were harder to make ‚Äúconfetti-like‚Äù than other brands I have used. However, the price it is for the amount of balloons is great."
"These pieces are really cute, but more for a child. They feel a little costume-y. I'm glad I bought them, but I don't know that I would recommend them to friends without explaining how small the necklace is and toy-like."
I wore the first out after wearing them everyday in the house for 2 years. I have a sweat gland cyst on my foot making it very uncomfortable to walk. These shoes have saved me. I highly recommend. True to size
There are so many rubber bands I can‚Äôt even guess at the number of projects that could be completed. I have made 100+ bracelets and it hasn‚Äôt made a dent. It even has the hooks to connect the necklace or bracelet.
"... you typed in &#34;magnifying glass&#34; in search, and this was one of your choices.I wanted an ornate magnifier for my over-the-top Bible.Reading is comfortable, lens is well constructed, and beautiful! I am MOST satisfied with my purchase, you will be too..."
This necklace is even more beautiful in person than the picture shows.  I Love it and have already worn it - magnificent. One of the prettiest pieces I own.  Just beautiful - I can't do it justice in written words.
This was gift for my son and then also a pink one for my daughter and they are made very cheaply every thing that is a part of this set is not made well at all. Don‚Äôt waste your money
"I purchased two of these, but they turned out to not be tall enough in my tank. They're very well made, and pretty, but after placing them in my rocks there wasn't a lot of room left under the bottom for my fish to enter it."
"I really wanted to buy some nekojarashi from Japan but I didn't want to pay $30 in shipping. Fortunately this seller came through. My cat loves these toys, and they are way better quality here than the ones I got from Daiso."
"I didn't read the finer details. Like, these are &#34;Real&#34; and smaller &#34;Twigs of WOOD&#34;. Hahaha, ahaha!! & I'm laughing too hard and much more! Gotta give it to you, for packaging, details, and making $$'s like &#34;Pet Rocks&#34;! Yeah!"
I bought these for a glow party & only a half worked.  All  had the clear tabs still in them. But the batteries were either dead or lasted like 10 mins... I wasn't too impressed.. just glad there were 80 pieces  & others to choose from..
"nothing like it's pictured to be. granted, i'm very tall, but i also ordered two other knee-length pencil dresses and the other two approached my knee whereas this dress only went a few inches past my butt. cute color though"
"I have other address stamps that have worked well. You have to be super careful to put pressure on all parts of this stamp to get a good result. Otherwise, some letter print half-way. Ok for one-off envelope, but not when doing 10s and 100s at a time."
I absolutely love this broom set. I have never bought a broom with such soft bristles and I'm not complaining. It's very nice. This broom set itself is the perfect addition to pet owners home. I sweep a lot and I love this broom and butler set.
"I bought a few of these calculators to be used in a office environment and they are not reliable. Each day I hear complaints that the buttons stick on these devices, so calculations are often incorrect due to pressed buttons not being recognized.Don't waste your money on this calculator."
I purchased this for my wife she loves it. She uses it in bed on the couch and on the kitchen table with her Apple air laptop computer.  Being able to adjust the height and the angle of the table is a big plus would definitely recommend.
thought this would be the same relative sizing as the large orbee ball on rope -- my 4 month dobe will be able to swallow the large by the time he is 8 months -- sorry i also ordered the medium.
Tasted this years ago in Israel and brought some home. Since then it has been my go-to olive oil. It tastes clean works so well with every food group. Started to buy it here as one bottle is 1 liter. Easier to store and use.
I'm convinced that these are the best MTG sleeves in existence. Dragon Shield has always been the GOAT sleeves but adding matte finish to the full art is ideal. I would buy nothing but these sleeves if they had a variety of art.
There were no reviews so I was a little skeptical on what the quality would be but it‚Äôs great. Material is thick & not see through. The shorts or shirt will be cute styled alone or together. I ordered in black & will be repurchasing in another color.
"Did not come with instructions as to how the cages were put together, so we put some of them together wrong, also all of the sliding doors were not in ludes so We had to take some from the other cages."
These paint cups are great!  They allow me to let my 3 year old the freedom of painting without me worrying about a huge mess. And the colored tops make it easy for him to see which color is in each cup.
"I am very happy with the cage...but, there aren't any bars to hang bird toys from; it is a solid piece across the top in both cages.  I had to hang a chain across the top, in order to hang toys from."
Worth every cent! Bought this huge pack for my kids and the kids on the block who all play outside. Now no fighting over colors. My only issue is they are wrapped in bundles of 6 and difficult to open the plastic without possibly breaking some.
"I like this product.  It mixes well, cleans up fast, seems pretty durable (although I haven't yet put it in the dishwasher).  My only concern is that I can't find any marking on the bottom to indicate the safety of the plastic material. Country of manufacture: China"
These Pads are my least favorite refill pads. The Breeze Pads are the best and the most expensive. The Amazon Basic Cat Pads are not as absorbent as the Breeze brand but are economical and not as smelly as the charcoal pads.
"My students and I enjoy the convenience of having these dry erase circles directly on our work table. I only gave 3 stars because 2 of the 6 came with a seam running through. One of them has torn at the edge of the line. Otherwise, would have been perfect."
"This clipboard is wonderfully made and high quality.  Unlike some cheaper clipboards, there are no rough screws or bolts on the back of the board.  It is a nice thick piece of wood with a beautiful finish.  It's very classy for our in house office."
"Love it. Received this item in about 2 weeks, and was delivered by truck, which they were kind enough to put in the backyard for me.  The cart was easy to put together, and is a perfect size for all the branches and debris from our yard.  Perfect!"
Perfect for those oils that you always have on hand - rollers and i was even able to get a bottle of fractionated coconut oil in there! It's lightweight and holds so many oils! If you don't love it- gift it. It's sure to please!
"100% comparable to the $25+ rope leash at Petco. Works great, I've thrown it in the washer too and all is fine. hearty clip + sweet little D ring near the handle for a potty bag holder thing. We love it."
"This purse is BIG! It holds way more than I need it to, and it's perfect! Super sturdy construction, and the shipping, while not super-fast simce it came from overseas, was faster than I expected. The wallet is also really well-made. A perfect pair- thank you!"
"Just started collecting Pok√©mon cards. I‚Äôve had hesitations on buying cards over 20 dollars. My biggest fear is getting a card scratched up or signs of heavy use. But this card came in the best condition, that I would want to try and get it graded. Would buy another one."
The boots are gorgeous!  They look just like the photo.  They do run a tad bit small-- I ordered my usual size and they were very tight at both the foot and calf.  I'm going to order them again a half size up.
"Heard about these from a certain 'Ruined' Youtuber and had to get some. It's my new 'get out of jail free' or 'do you know who I am?' card. The more certain people are offended and outraged, the better. Everyone I've given them to loves it."
This kit has everything needed to change to new nose pads. I bought a different kit but that kit didn‚Äôt have tweezers and it cost the same as this kit. The case is small enough to fit in a purse.
"I was looking more for a trivia game and these are games that are played on the show. One of them is unbelievably hard to figure out, at least for me it is. I do enjoy the show and two of the games in the box though."
This item is a perfect reason to add a zero stars review. They don't even deserve a 1 star review. I can't think of to many other things I've used that fail so miserably at the single purpose that they were designed for. They SUCK!
Shoddy workmanship...glued hooks that were not positioned correctly. Two of the hooks were pieced and glued on to the scrolls so badly it looked as if a child may have put it together. Product damaged and bent on arrival. Definitely returning this item.
The ‚Äúbubbles‚Äù pop in and out easily. They are really good sized (adult palm size). The UFO shape is cool and gives you a big ‚Äúbubble‚Äù to ‚Äúpop‚Äù as well (the dome of the UFO). This set is a good value!
Not sure how durable this little monkey is as I purchased it as a gift and it is still in a bag. The print on the little sweater is very good and came amazingly fast!  I will have no problem giving this as a gift.
These are slippery and slide down constantly. They are also not has high waisted as others I have so that makes it worse. I've tried a number of different workout pants and these are by far my least favorite. Wish I would have returned them.
I bought this with a bunch of other stuff for my boyfriends birthday. Fawkes is one of his favorite magical creatures so I was excited to find the flocked version of this pop. It arrived in perfect condition which I know can be hit or miss when buying pops online.
"While you have to blend it well it has none of the gritty texture some of the others have. When I discovered my old pea protein contained Glyphosate despite organic, I researched and immediately switched. I certainly don't regret it."
"Puzzle packaged well, the puzzle pieces are in a ziplock bag. Will ensure pieces don‚Äôt get lost.Very colorful and vibrant. The backing if the puzzle pieces are lettered - this will be great for younger children to allow them to sort the pieces before putting together. A great price too"
"the elastic waistband is too small for the way the rest of the skirt is cut. the fabric is good, nice color, they just need to use st chief elastic so it doesn't cut in. it's that really rigid thick elastic"
"I have 2 of these in a 29 gal tank for my Cory catfishes,  they love it & I‚Äôm planning to order more. I received my first order cracked in savers pieces but they immediately sent me replacements üëçüèΩ"
Our granddaughter will play with these toys for hours. Well build and very life like to make play time even better. The best part about these toys are there is no batteries or WI-fi needed.  Well worth the investment...
"I am thoroughly impressed with this car wash concentrate. I used it with my pressure washer and it gave a nice foam coating throughout. After cleaning with a microfiber towel and then rinse with the power washer again, my car now is clean and super shiny!"
"I bought these for the car. The size and shape are great for that, but the tissues are very small and very rough. OH well, the boxes are cute, so I'll figure out something to do with them when the tissues are gone. : )"
It‚Äôs the exact size to fit on the lid of my sewing box. The box is on the bottom level of my side table next to my chair. It has enough space on the days to write in appointments and such. Great buy!
The puzzle is very nice nice but the pieces are extremely tiny. They are the size of a penny. It makes it not fun to put together as the pieces are hard to grasp. I do not recommend this puzzle or brand
"Item is cheep and ripped the first time my husband put them on. The stitching came apart where the Green Lantern symbol is. It was a gift for my husband from our son. Side note, my son spent his own money for this item. üòû"
It‚Äôs great and love every page of it but it‚Äôs smaller than I thought I‚Äôm also left handed so it‚Äôs hard to write in such a small notebook ! I was expecting the book to be like a planner or notebook wide not like a diary size
"These insoles are so sticky you can't where socks with them or your toes get caught and smashed.  If you could take these and put a slick covering on the top they would be perfect.  As they stand now, don't bother wasting your money."
"I bought one of these for my girlfriend a while ago, and though it's a fairly broad nib, it's a smooth pen that she's had no issues with. It worked great right out of the box, though sadly it doesn't come with a converter."
"My 4 and 7 year olds love playing with these. All you need is a wet paper towel and young kids can go to town making endless crafts. Love that it‚Äôs not messy, they can do it themselves. Light and small enough to pack on trips, etc. Great find."
"Functionally these wings were fine, but I was hoping for more of a coral-y color the way they look in the picture. The wings I got seemed more magenta than the item picture made them look. I ended up returning them and ordering a different color directly from the website."
"These earrings are just beautiful!  The seller is very helpful and customer service is outstanding!  They are light weight, perfect for sensitive ears. Maybe I can find a ring that matches!! Thank you for all your assistance and helpful communication!!"
The foam roller was ordered as a gift for my husband who drives a lot for work and does a lot of work around the house. He used it as soon as it arrived. He loved the instructions that came with it.
I sent this one back within days. Every time the dogs got a drink I had to add more water to keep it circulating. I messed with thinking I had it set up wrong. But n a few days realize it wasn‚Äôt.
Purchased this for my sons first birthday and he loved it. He kept it next to him while he opened all his other gifts and played in his mash cake. He even sleeps with it sometimes and makes a perfect addition to his growing elmo collection.
"Nicely organized, but too small.  Due to it's compact size, there is not enough room for my student to write in all her homework & other assignment details.  She ends up having to put arrows ect. to write the details elsewhere."
"My mare was constantly rubbing her shoulders after being bitten by flies...we tried injections, supplements and this was the answer.  We call it her sundress and it has been great all summer long.  She wears it day and night."
The product did not do what it claimed it would. I followed it to the letter of the instructions. Very disappointed. To be fair this is after a week of using it. I will continue for another week or two to see if there is any changes.
"This is my favorite style of necklace from this vendor. I've purchased many of the colors offered and they mix and match so well together or stand alone. Love it single or doubled, or with an enhancer clipped on. Happiness around my neck!"
I bought these to put in my UGGS because the padding was worn down. They are quite comfortable but make my heels feel like they are going to pop out when walking. I may need to attempt to remove the current insole and replace instead of having these on top.
"The flavor, Caramel blue is great, not so much, the chocolate. Nice small amount with high fiberbut has more sugar than the same brand non night time formula. Right now Caramel bliss seems to be out of stock.  üôè they get more soon!"
"This unit came sealed and boxed. Brand new as advertised. I have used it to print about 200 pages so far, and quality is excellent. I am planning to purchase another for my second printer. For that price it is a great deal."
The product fell apart when the package was opened. Small nails were used for the lid hinge and the lid came off. An inside piece glued inside the box fell off; the glue didn't hold it. The outside metal emblem was cheaply done with dents and was hammered in.
"My 18 month old Chessie could pull it off the floor in about 1 minute.  Not sure if suction is strong enough for strong doggies.  He is enjoying finding treats but as a tug toy, does not meet our needs.  Too expensive for value received."
"The grater does the job, and the fact that it folds is awesome (and why I got it) when I fold and unfold it though it makes a loud clicking sound that scares me because I thought it was going to break, but I guess it just makes that sound"
I've gotten many compliments on my badge. I love it. the only bad part is the paint... i've only had it for a month and the eye paint is coming off. not sure how long it will last. but cute nonetheless.
"This leash works great with my two small dogs, they are not used to walking on a leash.. so it‚Äôs normally a task walking them together. However; they do not get tangled and tolerate being on a leash just fine."
"This is one of the most practical purchases I‚Äôve made in a long time. I do a lot of Letter writing especially since Covid, so I decided to keep everything well organized and easy to move around. This was a great option."
This was perfect for the 4th of July. The colors were very vibrant. After 2 days is was beginning to fade so I gave her a bath and it is nearly all out. I will probably buy again for Halloween and Christmas!!!
This is so perfect for your pet. Anyone can scan the QR code and see your pets picture right away. It‚Äôs also helpful for having all the other useful and helpful pet information on it. Love that there are a lot of choices.
"These eggs do not come prefilled.  Also, the Lego men come in parts and need to be put together. Huge pain and inconvenient.  Plan on spending a good hour at least putting these men together and filling the eggs."
"Lovely. I purchase 6 pieces of them. Necklace , Bracelet and earrings.  The quality of gemstone are great and the quality and color of the chain looks like 18 carat gold. I will buy more and more as they are very beautiful. Thank you"
"I really like the bag but the stap that comes with it is very small & doesn't let it hang appropriately on my body. I'm 5'5"" 200#ish. I'm a larger up top lady. All in all the bag is good."
My kid absolutely loves making these. We have several different styles of the window clings from this brand. The rainbow and sunshine were her favorite because we can leave them up all year round. (The other versions we have were all holiday themed)
This is a great product the dji mini 2 stock is to low to the ground the camera can hit now with your landing gear it has plenty of clearance it's a must have if you own a dji mini 2!
"It's working perfectly for my large jar of conditioner. I don't like 'double dipping' and this has been the perfect solution. I read some of the reviews where the neck broke, so I've been gentle with it and had no problems."
You know it's hard to say whether these work or not because you don't notice a difference however my doctor swears by them so I will continue taking them I like the fact that these are for women not sure if it matters but I like it
Purchased this on recommendation of Havanese owner. My Havanese has very thick long coat and was taking well over an hour to dry. With the Double K ChallengAir 9000ll I can dry him in less than 1/2 hour. Word of advice lock the wheels before starting the dryer. Love it
"Very clean and elegant looking, I bought two, one for my home, and another for my bedroom at my parents house, I love the magnetic charging feature of this charging unit for your DJI mini or your DJI mini 2, both magnetic adaptors included in the box"
"Very nice looking and feeling, but I was surprised they were too big to be able to wear without alteration. I'd consider ordering a size smaller than usual. ( I'm 5'6 and 320 lbs and have to work to keep them up, lol.)"
"If it stated that this was suppose to be a super thin shirt, I didn't see it. Had I known it was super thin and not a sweatshirt, I wouldnt have ordered it. Also the neck is too big. It had good potential though, I guess."
"I absolutely loved these.  But, unfortunately, I lost one the first time I wore them.  I should have put some sort of back on them.  I'll keep looking for the one I lost, but may just order another pair because they are so cute."
"This sword is great! My daughter used it for a Princess Leia costume. My daughter opted for a lightsaber instead of a blaster. The sound effects sound authentic, it's very bright, and seems well-constructed. A great buy at this price!"
"Was a hit for my nephews 1st birthday! Even the older kids wanted to play with it. It is a little stiff so I was worried someone might force the doors open, but its made well so he has been enjoying it so far!"
Pretty quality journal I purchased as a gift for a friend who uses a journal;. She loved the design and print on the cover and how you can add refill paper. I think she will get much use out of this journal. A great gift.
"I bought this for a cruise this summer, It is super cute! I am 5'1&#34; 130lb. I ordered a size 6 and it fits perfect. I wear size 36C bra so I'm going to have to figure out how to sew in a bra top. Other than that it's great."
I love the style of these planners. The stickers are always cute and the planners always last the entire year plus without wear. Not always a fan of the front cover I loved last years a little better but the quality has me buying every time!
"Used for1 month, the fabric between the card pockets is already ripping at the seams :/ if you don't use every slot then maybe it would last. But what's the point of so many card slots if you can't use them."
My only complaint is that there is no way this envelope will close around this 3-D card. Just like the other reviews I have the same thing to say they should‚Äôve should‚Äôve made sure to consider the size of the actual card before making these envelopes
"I can't get over how soft this hairbrush is. it's well made, and you can switch the bristles of the brush really easy works very easy it does a good job at breaking up cradle cap. would make for a great baby shower gift."
"I like these rings and they are the perfect size for my nose, but they unfortunately came in gold rather than rose gold.  The color is okay... just a little brighter than what I was expecting or hoping for"
"Appears well made, tough plastic, and comes with two ""caps"" to increase to fit different size bottles. Measures approx 9 inches in length, 6 inches in width and 2.75 inches high.  Dogs like it!UPDATE:Another reason to like it--very easy to clean!"
"I got one of these to stash a key in case I ever get locket out of my home or need to give someone access in an emergency. It's a solid unit. I've used similar ones before. 5 digit code, room for two keys, rugged design."
"Love this dress so much more than I anticipated. Wasn't totally loving the colors or look, but once i got it on, I've been wearing it at least once a week. So flattering and not too long on my 5 foot frame!!!"
Love the price and quality of the product. I bought them to have students write Thanksgiving thank you cards for their favorite teachers. The cards were a hit with the teachers and had very nice designs. Would definitely buy again.
"It is a bit dusty and expensive.  All crystal litter is overpriced.  It is safe from the basic problem with most silica cat litter, as are a few others that are not as dusty.  Not bad though."
The tie die shirt come exactly how it looks but the material is thicker than what you expect. It doesn‚Äôt fit very flattering because of the thickness of the material and it‚Äôs very long. It also runs big. I got a medium but fits like a large.
"My dog with allergies can only eat this food.  I have tried him on numerous high quality products, but the potato & duck seems to be the least allergic for him.  The product arrived quickly & was a good bit cheaper than the local pet store."
"This kit does not include the correct balloons. It was missing the unicorn, foil heart, foil star, the clear balloons didn‚Äôt have sparkles on them (were just plain clear). Very disappointed to have a very basic kit for my daughters 3rd birthday."
The stone is a fun gift for a 6 y/o however it is not red glass all the way through as someone wrote me prior to purchasing. It came with scratches where I can see that it's coated. Hope it lasts at least a few weeks.
"Lightweight, not too small but not too big. Easy to leave open & find page when closed because of page divider, although I wish the divider was thicker and sturdier.  I like the layout.  Love the inclusion of post its"
"This product does have a few kinks in it.  For a few days it was fine, then I have had to shake it a couple of times to make the ink work better.  It has been fine since then."
"What can I say about doggie bags? Nice size and weight, but very difficult to tear bags apart on the perforated line. Easier to cut apart with scissors along perforation.  I now have a basket full, but don't think I will reorder again, due to this issue"
"have been a Builder for 30 years and by the age of 55 I have arthritis in my knees, this bandage holds well on my knee well, frozen ice pack lasts about 30 minutes, Wife took herself ice rounds to relieve headaches"
I  love the tires and the resealable packaging. I  personally had a problem with a cracked rim. Not sure if I should get new rims or a new set. The tire on the cracked rim seems to be just fine.
I just got it but unfortunately my box was missing parts so  cannot finish the castle and its missing all the figures . Bummer cause the box art is great n it looked like it was a great built .
"Bought 12 of these for my bridesmaids to wear on my bachelorette and they were a hit! Thick plastic so they lasted all weekend and I sometimes were them on the lake or by the pool even after the bachelorette! They do scratch easily, but hey, they're still worth it."
"Great I love the pens, they‚Äôre beautiful and have a heavy feel to it . Definitely not the cheap plastic knock offs. The only thing preventing me from giving them 5 stars is they gave me two Hermione wands and an elder wand. I am missing Harry‚Äôs wand."
This handy little hair remover works just as well as the more expensive one out there. It leaves the skin smooth and hair free with no stubble. Makeup goes on so much better. It's quick and easy to use. Great purchase!
Have been using the EPS Brand in my Dell C1660W for past 2 years or so.  Now I also have a Dell MPF E525WPS and am saving lots of money with these after market replacements.  They work just as well as the OEM for me.
"Works as expected and def the best overall cat fountain ive used.  Always go with stainless steel (over plastic) fountains, that have a legit filter system.  Dont really need as family drinks berkey water, but good for refiltering cat spit, hair, etc from fountain"
This made a great gift for my husband. He was very happy about it and put it to use immediately on his desk - he works from home. It‚Äôs one of those things people don‚Äôt realize they need until they see it.
"I love the container.  The pads are so soft and gentle.  They clean up easily and dry completely.  I haven't used the whole package, so throwing them into the washing machine will be a new experience. We will see.  They arrived very quickly."
Can't beat the price on this canine barbel; easy for small  dogs to pick  and hold.  It appears to be exactly the same as the higher priced versions since I have both.  I'll buy this one again.
"It's a cute keychain, but waaay bigger than it looks in the pic. I recommend they put the dimensions on the description. It's also pinker than I was expecting. Kind of a rose gold color. I don't mind it, just looks different in person than in the pic."
Show in picture is a ladies 8. I just noticed the last has an S on it so I must have missed the other sizes. Might work too line a basket or hang on something as soon in the picture on line.
"Actually, ordering these was my fault for not reading the description more closely.  The holes for the flag poles are too small and so now they are useless to me; sitting in a box in the corner.  :-("
"The shirt was perfect. Soft and fit right. But the pants were a different material and not as soft, and about 2 sizes larger than the shirt. They were super baggy and several inches too long. I'm 5'4"", around 125-130 and ordered medium. I returned."
Fit my friends 14 year old perfectly when they came (size medium). Washed in cold water and they shrunk so much they‚Äôre now more like a size zero. Even her 9 year old sister can‚Äôt wear them because they‚Äôre too small.
My dogs have learned to I open the pantry and stare until I give them one of these treats.  Both have had major surgeries with a neurologist; neck and spine and this gives them a little pep in their step.
Our Breville Nespresso maker flashed and the manual said it needed descaling so I looked on Amazon and found this set. It worked easily following the included directions. You could see the milky calcium water coming out if the machine.
Bought this for adding rpm telemetry sensor. Turns out I didn't even need it when going to install. The one that came with car already had sensor holder. That is why only 4 stars from me. I guess now I have a spare.
"Bought this for a friend to hang up in his bar and I must say it looks nice. It arrived in great shape, brand new as advertised and definitely gets a kick out of people when they stop over for a few beers."
"Picture says all. Neither of the most common arcade joysticks are supported by this. Was trying to convert HAPP to Sanwa, turns out it doesn't even line up with Sanwa, much less HAPP. Ironically, Sanwa is one of the only specific things this product even lists."
This is a perfect piece to take out for presentations with literature rack and a place for your computer on top.  Very sturdy.  Easy to pack up and has a small case.  It is a bit heavy but not unmanageable.  Excellent price!
It's exactly what I was looking for what I need the backing though being hollow really isn't a great Vocal Point I cleaned out the back side and added a little silver paint and it helped it to pop and look better
"The idea behind the design of this trimmer seems good. This trimmer painfully pulled more hair than it trimmed.It is my fault that I was too busy to return it in time, but now $28 for a trimmer that is painful to us only more pain."
I have a few bagged/boarded comics that I want to protect before grading. These fit modern comics perfectly and give me a little more peace of mind when transporting them. These feel like a good choice to protect modern comics before grading.
"These rollers work great on my calluses and tough heel skin!  They fit great in my Amope Pedi Perfect, but are a much better bargain than their replacement rollers.  I find these rollers to be of great quality and performance and would recommend them to anyone."
"The case looked good when I opened the box.  However after struggling with it for a few minutes, I couldn't get the gold clam shaped box to open.  My husband also tried to no avail.  Returned.  Cheap product, poorly made."
Very nice and decently priced. Only drawback is the way it comes out of the bottle. Very difficult to get out compared to a bottle with a dropper. But the bottle is quite small so a dropper probably isn‚Äôt an option.Would buy again.
i thought I was ordering my normal brand (packaging is similiar) and when they came these stink so badly that I got on to see what I orderd.  i am taking these out and returning.  It's awful.  No one should even be able to smell this stuff!!!!
Not as large as I thought it would be which is a good thing.  Love the front pocket (great to toss keys in).  Straps are adjustable but not by much.  Overall a good bag for the price.
I loved this item! It came in a nice box with a very sharp looking leather wrist strap! Very very unique watch! I love it! I definitely recommend as a railroad approved watch and just a great watch to wear in general! üòä
Had already nailed some pictures to the wall. Was buying this product to keep all the pictures from shifting and looking messy. This tape would not even stick to my wall making the project useless. Will have to find something else to keep my pictures level.
My son has been attending a lot of graduation parties and this value pack of cards made it much easier to be sure we had one on the ready. I love the Hallmark card quality and it helps me be prepared at all times.
"I bought this for a friend who is a Harry Potter fan  and she loves it. It is made of kind of a silky material, the elastic ear loops are adjustable so easy to fit making it comfortable to wear"
"Had been using another brand which seemed to run out before I had made very many copies. Decided to try this one about the same price and print quality good so far. Not sure about number of copies, but time will tell."
Exactly what I needed. Thank you so much. I'm paralyzed and these are the only tubes that keep me up & independent in the pool. A little sad that this one already opened up in the seam. After 10 uses. So far the Orange is good
"I have used this product since my dog was a puppy. She is a Chihuahua Mix, and I found this to be effective in keeping her clean without causing any skin irritation. I also appreciate the price, and the way the bottles were carefully wrapped in the package."
"Had this set up for Amazon subscription, but was out of stock on the 1st and the 2nd scheduled subscription delivery, so I dropped it.As far as the quality of the product it's excellent. I now just try to order it when it looks like I'll need it."
This necklace is true to picture online in color and size. The clasp appears strong. The necklace has a good weight to it as well. This is a very nice statement necklace. I was privileged to purchase this necklace with a discount to test and honestly review.
west paw zogoflex dog toys are wonderful.  haven't had to replace any in the past 4 years.  very durable.  this ball is just the right size for my shih tzu/maltese.  easy for him to pick up and play with.
"Shipped promptly and does what it's supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It's advertised as 9 1/2 X 11, which is why I bought it, bigger than normal, but it's actually only 9 X 8.  A little spendy for a regular old mouse pad."
"It's hard to find a cap for us Destroyer folk, unless you have one personalized.  But this one has already drawn attention to wandering eyes.  I hold my head a little higher when they say..., ""Thank you for your service""."
Great platform. Our little hammy loves it and she won‚Äôt come from under it. But the ladder is horrible. Ladder has 2 metal loop hooks on both ends but nothing to hook it too on the platform. Also very stiff and not useable. But the platform works fine without it.
"Many have said this product is no good but I myself find no flaw in this product.I do not use it very heavy, one drop for the entire guitar.I use other cleaning products as well but this seems to work good."
This is gorgeous however its cheaply made and  metal silver embellishments literally fell off it as I took it out of the bag and all over the ground. I believe they were supposed to be on the front of it? Disappointed with that but it is pretty.
"Cheaply made, it is supposed to work for most body parts for light massage. It only came with one resistance band. Good idea, but the execution is missing. I prefer to use a foam roller and a massage ball. Not recommended."
"I used this product for many years, start in the spring and it works to get a smoother look to my skiing, belly, hips, legs, etc...Use it constantly and it works even better. I am very satisfied with this product. Thank you"
ZERO STARS. Bought this item and it was broken straight out of the box. I exchanged it for another one and that one broke 3 months later. . Outside the return window. Now my tropical fish are swimming in cold water.
"My husband wears a medium size in shirts.  This is a great, silky sweatshirt and the colors are very vibrant.  The only issue is that it is very large for him.  I am keeping it because I can wear it with leggings since it's so long."
"Holy Stone makes great drones, and you can get replacement pieces and parts at low prices.  If you've ever called or emailed their customer service, you know how outstanding this company is to work with.  I will only buy Holy Stone drones."
"I love the style and comfort of these sandals. I bought them in three different colors, all at different stores, because they are so comfortable and cute. I get compliments on them all the time, so I'll continue to purchase them when I find them in different colors."
Please can someone help me find the assembly instructions for this product?I got it from a friend without instructions. It is a beautiful easel but has just been sitting in a box for the past three months. I have searched EVERYWHERE but still cannot find anything. Please help
this product is amazing. the quality is great. I had an issue with my initial order but the company quickly took care of that and I ordered another one in its place. great product. . great service. . you will be inspired by this every morning.
I received this cute toy and I like it very much too. The stuffed elephant toy is soft fabric with squeaky sound. Awesome material and the size is perfect for medium furchild. Not sure how long it will last. I will update later.
We bought two sets of these as part of our party favors for my son's 11th birthday party.  Three of them are broken so we now don't have enough to pass out to the children. Very disappointed. I can understand one being defective but THREE with holes? No.
"This is the best cold pack I've found. Wonderful in every way. However, it did rupture after just a couple of uses, so I'm exchanging it. Chalking it up to manufacturing defect. GREAT product. I use it for sports/exercise inflammation."
"My parents were introduced to this product  when I was 12yrs old I used to have warts  on each finger, after taking maltlevol 12 liquid all the warts disappeared Now I,M 69yrs  I still  take it but for energy {like a mvi-build up }"
"Huge hit in my house!  Just wish there was a way to extend the length of play time.  It seems to end too quickly.  Then again, it could just be that we are having fun so time seems to be flying."
"I usually wear XS (black) but I like how the small fits (Yellow). It's more of a spandex feel. I think the xs will move around as I move and I'll have to keep adjusting it. My measurements are 34"" bust, 27"" waist, 35"" hips, 22"" arms."
[[VIDEOID:595c81d5c124cbfb04dbb15973c8473e]] My dogs enjoy drinking from their new water bottle. It is easy to use and take when traveling. The 2 in 1 design is practical and perfect. No more losing or forgetting  the collapsible bowl when heading out to the dog park.
"I like the clip design, with them the panels feel sturdier and less prone to coming apart than most other acrylic cases in this price range. Easy to assemble with plenty of extra nail/caps. The included instructions could be written better."
"Labels were easy to use, company was fast to ship and customized well.  The labels did fade in the wash and didn't always stay on, especially to my girls bathing suits, which was annoying because I bought the labels for camp."
"Very cute designs on these glasses but you‚Äôd be better off purchasing some from the dollar tree. They are constantly loose. Keep in mind if you purchase them, you will need an eyeglass repair kit on hand at all times."
"Now my dog will go out and potty!  I love love love this umbrella.  Before we got it, it was a chore and a fight to take our puppy out in the rain to potty.  This umbrella solved our problem."
Haven't worn it yet as intended.  Plan to take it to Spain this summer when I walk the El Camino de Santiago.  Looks perfect for my needs.  I like that it has &quot;sleeves&quot; instead of just an over the head poncho as so many are.
This 8 oz bottle used lightley works good obsorbs in the skin quickly. This bottle sent was called baby silk.  I didn't like the smell.  Next I will order unsented. One other reviewer said unsented even smells. I'll let you know next time.
"Absolutely love this purse. Durable, great color and great amount of space/pockets for my stuff and the random kids stuff that gets put into my purse! Plan to order another when this one bites the dust but not sure if it ever will!"
The fountain pen is a nice green color.  It started writing the first time I used it.  No skipping and a really nice ink flow.  I will be purchasing the pink pen in the near future.  I really like this pen.

I could literally not get my foot into this slip on boot. I had a family member with similar foot size try and he could not either. Bummed me out as I did a ton of research and seller had a great price and great service.
As of the time I purchased these they are still only a 36 pack not a 48 pack as stated in the item title and description. I did not use any so I can't speak to the quality but they appeared to be comparable to the others I have.
I would have rated it higher if it hadn't come damaged. The stylus cap was irrecoverably wedged into the over cap. Which made that part unusable.  Other than that it was a decent pen.  All the other features appeared to be as described.
"Overall really good. You do need to be aware that this works via usb though. I thought when I bought it that it would have a standard plug in. Had I bothered reading the description, I'd probably be aware, but..."
"I'm one of those ppl that doesn't like to untie my shoes to take them off or put them on.  This has saved my shoes from breaking down the heel putting them on.  So easy to use, bought a second one for my locker at work."
I would say between 3 - 4 out of every 10 envelopes are missing the self adhesion strip and glue.  You cannot seal the envelopes with using a glue stick.  Now I know why they were so inexpensive.  Buyer Beware.
"The fabric of the main shirt/hood is incredibly thin, and the sleeves have a weird sheen to them? Also the product image makes it look like it would be a longer crop top, it's not, and I wish it had fit longer like I was anticipating."
"Love these boots. The look is awesome and the fit is exactly how I would expect it. I typically go with Adidas FG cleats and these ones have served me well. I play alot on turf and these cleats are really, really durable. I'm thinking about getting a second pair!"
"This Nendoroid is superb. I have a few, and this is definitely one of my favorite. It comes with a lot of extras, more than most. The quality‚Äã is amazing, and it is super cute. I cannot recommend it enough. If you love Penguindrum, you should get this."
"Purchased one just to test it.... then had to buy for everyone in office and for another office.  Well built, feels great, looks very nice, price is reasonable. Our employees love them. Great choice compared to many more expensive options"
This is not a 16x25x4!!! I was looking for a 15.5x24x3.75 and found this one to fit perfectly!!! I had a had time finding one with these odd measurements at hardware stores. I'm glad I found one here. Will definitely purchase again!
I  have a baby Shih Tzu and he loves trhis pen. I leave the front door open and the side door lifted up. Definitely buy the pad that goes in it. It is easy to raised an lower for storage. Super sturdy.
I just had my teeth cleaned at the dentist dr. Nabors recommended I get a waterpik after thorough reviews of products I chose this cordless water flosser really gets back in my wisdom teeth and cleans the guck out I love it
"Although the shoe runs a little smaller than my oofo shoes, I still am able to wear them. They feel like a stable shoe. I have struggled finding shoes to wear with plantar fasciitis. I hope to get another pair and go up a size."
This is the smoothest mechanical pencil I own. The mechanism spins the lead in such a way as to prevent a chisel edge that can snag your paper. It provides a smooth writing feel as if it was a ball point pen.
"These boots are even cuter in person, they are adorable! I bought them for my 6 year old Granddaughter and as she had a huge smile on her face said ""These are so stylish MoMo"" (grandma). Since then she wears them almost daily and finds them to be very comfortable."
"I installed it like any other ink cartridge and began printing without any issues.  I got about twice the ink for about half the price (so about 4x cheaper) than the original manufacturer ink, yet the print quality is just as good."
"For 12 pairs @ $7.49 (at the time of purchase), these are excellent. Very stretchy, but probably won't accommodate very large hands. The wrist opening edging is unseamed/unfinished, so they ride up a little, but the cotton itself is thicker and softer than I had expected."
"Weak spots in the band. I placed it on an 18' x 18&#34; art board, but never expanded it over a drawing pad. Didn't last a year, even without 'use'. Guess you get what you pay for and this was no exception. Including shipping, it was not worth the price."
Chair leans forward so I find myself constantly readjusting every 5-10 minutes. Back is not adjustable like the pictures shows. Either you have it locked in the forward slanted position or its unlocked so you can lean back(but it's not comfortable due to the pressure required to rock it back).
"I don't understand the positive reviews for this item at all.If you like overpaying for a few flashcards, a couple of cheap books and some cardboard, paper and stickers, then by all means buy it.If you're looking for something to teach and entertain a two-year-old, look elsewhere."
This is my third time ordering and using ink4work ink of my two Canon PIXMA MB5420's and I am very  pleased with this ink. It cost only a fraction what the Canon ink cost. I recomend this in to all my friends.
"The range for the Bass is messed up. It has a Low C, two ledger lines below the staff, which is good... but the C and the ledger lines on the poster do not go below the staff, and end up on a B/A."
"I got these for my boyfriends birthday, he's been wanting new house slippers. I was a little concerned about the size because of other reviews, but I went with his regular size and it fit perfectly! He loves them! Super comfy, soft and warm."
Ouch! Sure if you can manage it in there with minimal pain go for it but it just wasnt for me. I get the concept but the delivery is damn near impossible and not to mention PAINFUL. wish they would make something smaller and way softer.
Please DO NOT purchase this toy. It‚Äôs dangerous because the end the you blow up does not pop down like others. This can cause harm if your baby puts in mouth or it can easily poke baby in the eye.
I was looking for a soft core jumbo colored pencils and found them. I would say they are pricey compared to some popular brands but they are very bright and comfortable for little hands. I gave 4 stars because the envelope was squished badly and it ruined the box.
"I ordered this product and it is AWESOME!The colors are deep and rich and last A LONG, LONG TIME!!!As a teacher with tons of printing, I will be ordering another set as SOON AS MY CHECK COMES IN!My advice to you......GET IT NOW!!!"
"The wrist rest aspect serves its purpose, but I am not happy with the design. It looks nothing like picture in the gold marble. Wishing I would‚Äôve gotten another design? Maybe it would‚Äôve turned out better? It just looks tacky."
"Got it in February, it has worked well since, I like that the on switch is in the top right corner for my desk setup. Stopped heating mid-November same year, switch stays on like usual. This will be the second heating pad I've had this happen with."
"What a waste of money! These don‚Äôt have hinges on the arms of the glasses, like regular glasses do, so they feel terrible!The ache from the glasses is worse then being car sick! Also, buyer beware they are ineligible for a return."
"These boots were delivered on March 25. It is now April 27 and the soles are splitting in half. These are my daughter's favorite boots and she has worn them frequently, but only to school. I would have hoped they would have lasted longer."
"I like this metal stand, but I kind of wish it was a little heavier so I can highlight things without having to hold it to keep it from sliding.  It does what it's supposed to do: Holds papers well. Good quality, good price."
"Bought this for my son to wear at school for a name tag. His into Sonic right now so I taught it would be a great buy. The quality of the land yard is great, adjustable and safe to use for kids."
I got this for my brother in law because he is a huge fan and collecting this kind of stuff. They are pretty small but so cute he wants to collect them all now. HE loved them. He is not opening them so can't comment on that
I love my lapis lazuli! This is the stone of wisdom and royalty. I love the feel of it in my hand. It is the perfect size. I would recommend this stone to anyone who wants to meditate and feel the vibes.
"I loved the material, but I should have gone up one more size just for comfort. I thought going up one size would be enough, but it wasn't covering enough in the cleavage area and around my mid section I could have used an inch or two."
My son got these from angel tree for Christmas. I'd never heard of them before but we love them! To combat them picking up everything we play with them in the table and are very excited to play in the tub!
"Not making water clearer and the filter pads are harder to find for replacement,  The filter change indicator light always says to change even the day I changed filter so i have to keep the lid of the system or the light will always be on."
I have used this product for at least 12 years and would be devastated if I couldn‚Äôt continue to purchase it. It helps so much with digestion - I‚Äôm gluten intolerant and take one when ever I cheat. It settles my stomach very quickly.
"When I saw these I had to have them for my daughters goody bags for her birthday. I just knew she would love them. Unfortunately, half of them came to me broken. All well, moving on to the next goody bag item I suppose."
This is exactly what I was looking for. My dog like to look through the window so it worked perfectly. It‚Äôs also good that it‚Äôs ready to use right out of the box and doesn‚Äôt require any mounting. My dog weighs close to 25 pounds and it is pretty sturdy.
"I bought this because my origami small Simon quit working, this new Simon is nothing like the original one. I don‚Äôt like it at all. But that being said, if you have never played the original simon then you won‚Äôt be disappointed"
"I love being able to get between my dog‚Äôs toes and it seems less likely to cut her. I‚Äôm not great yet at finding the angle that makes it cut. There is a reasonable amount of control with these clippers. Happy, but not in love. Pretty much what I expected."
Looks good in my Dennerle Scaper‚Äôs 10 gallon aquascape. Wasn‚Äôt able to find pool filter sand in a small bag on amazon so I tried this out. It did require a lot of cleaning to get the cloudiness to go away. I‚Äôm satisfied though
"This skirt is cute, but it's a little shorter than I was expecting - giving it more of a trendy tutu look than a more classy lacy look. The lace is pretty, but I wouldn't buy this skirt again, because I prefer a classic look to a cheaper modern look."
"These 2oz Plastic Cups are very colorful and can be used in a variety of ways. They are perfect for taking shots, bathroom cups, arts & crafts, paint, etc. They are sturdy, durable and reasonably priced. I like this product and I am pleased with it."
It has a good selection of different size boxes and the boxes are pretty sturdy. The only thing I wish it had was some more small boxes and less of the large ones. I think its a good value and would definitely recommend it.
"I love this seat cover so much I ordered another one for the drivers side. They not only match perfectly but they are beyond comfy along with stylish, oh and I almost for got the front pocket. I have had so many compliments on them.Highly recommend it"
"Printer was easy to install and works fine.  My only complaint is to find out, in order to make it wireless, I need to purchase an additional kit for $100.  Without the additional wirelesss kit, it's working on an Ethernet cable connection to the wireless modem."
"I placed an order for over a 1,000 of these 4x7.5 but received a third or more that were angled at 2 inches towards the bottom. The air in the bubbles did not last, and I am super bummed because these are unusable."
"This keychain is adorable, I'm so happy with the condition it came in and the packaging! I've gotten a few of these and they seem to hold up well with the beating my keys go through on a daily basis. Very impressed, they make great gifts as well!"
I have been taking these easy to swallow soft gels for a little over a week now and haven't noticed any difference at all.  They are very reasonably priced and have hemp oils with added B6 which is good to boost the immune system.
"Bought this to replace the driveshaft in a brushless 1/10 scale truck.  Didn't last 10 minutes before it sheared the pin on one end.  Might be fine for a less powerful truck, but i can't recommend it for anything brushless."
"I bought this for my granddaughter to go with the Gumby I gave her a year ago. She loves to play with them. They are good quality, fully bendable/‚Äúpose-able‚Äù and can stand up on their own. She‚Äôs very happy with them!  üíï"
I really wanted another barbie size table set on amazon but it was so expensive an I just could never get myself to buy it :( so I settled with this not expecting anything good but I was surprised! its so cute an sturdy! love it!
This is a very nice dish but I was disappointed in the color - I really thought it was going to be black but it's not - it's most definitely blue/navy blue (certainly and noticeably NOT black). The glaze is nice and the size is nice.
These were for my 12 year old daughter. She thought they were great. One thing we all dislike is when thee pads of the bra move from side to side in the wash. We will see if these do that. I hope not.
"Interesting to set up. I needed three AAA batteries and a small screwdriver. After the set up, it was pretty awesome! Using this to write my to-do‚Äôs, and it‚Äôs hard to ignore. A wet cloth is needed for cleaning but aside from that a pretty cool item!"
"This paste is very good, my husband has been using it for years. Doesn't go on too heavy, and holds shape well. Keep in mind that this is a very small, travel sized kind of container. Purchased as a stocking stuffer."
"I bought this for a 2 year old boxer Ruby, that is very strong and excitable. This leash helps me keep her in control and close to me while walking.  Ruby is such a good girl and we enjoy our walks now."
"The patter of the cork is attractive.  The frame appears to be covered in a wall paper like material.  it is attractive, not supper high end, but better than some aluminum office product like frame.  For the price I am satisfied."
"I use this for some of my artist supplies, watercolor. I wish the top shelf had a back to it like the lower two. But tha'ts only because it is set on a slight incline temporarily. I'm happy with it"
"I bought these thinking you could add legos to them. You cannot. I took a photo of each item next to a lego.  They are all, clearly, different sizes.  So disappointing.  As far as I see, it doesn‚Äôt say this anywhere in the description."
"The gait belt works quite well.  My ONLY problem is it is too long!  Do you really need a product that is approximately 5 feet long?  We can always tuck the excess under, and the product does exactly what we needed.  Thank you!"
"Easy to dispense, and I guess the dogs liked the flavor, they ate it all up, but I didn't notice any changes or benefits from the dogs having this. We have 3 giant breed dogs, and this bottle went very fast, but without seeing any benefits, decided not to reorder"
I love this bag and so did my 7 year old grand daughter.  I bought this for my grand daughter to put her horse grooming supplies.  It is feminine and claasy and looks like a good quality bag.  It is padded.  I would purchase sgain.
Thank You So much!!  I got this for my teeth health after taking this with calcium and vitamin d3 my teeth feels much better.  Thank you for making this convenient to order through amazon!  Keep up the great work!
"I beleive the outside is mostly plastic parts. The core is metal. Toy is heavy, very detailed. In general I like it I just dont have anything to compare to because this is the first toy I bought for myself."
"Now that I'm looking thru the other reviews it's obvious that this is a reoccurring issue that pieces are missing from the puzzle which is ridiculous. Smh... do better, apparently someone is consisted with making this a hard process for consumers."
This little office item really delivers big results!! So user friendly and works like one would expect it to. Basic and straight forward form and function for a great price!! A must for any home office or at work!! Highly recommended!!
These plates were for a birthday party and the only worry about ordering plates such as this is if they are flimsy.  These were durable enough and we had no issues with them.  Its hard to mess up paper plates though.
These Happy Holidays cards are pretty generic. They look like corporate cards that your insurance agent might send out. The cardstock has a good weight to it. The gold foil is a nice touch. The greeting is embossed. The general greeting is very politically correct and should not offend most.
"Nice ballon bouquet! My grandson loved it! Specially the Blaze ballon. It was my 1st time inflating helium balloons, but once I figured how to do it, with help from a friend, it was very easy! The company that sold them was very nice."
I really liked this necklace. It glowed quite brightly when I left it out in the sun. I actually though the picture was an exaggeration of the glow but it really isn't. The pendant is the size of my thumb.
"Our cat kept playing around, flipping over his water bowl, and leaving a mess in the laundry room. Now we don't have to worry about that anymore. We couldn't be happier with this fountain. The cat drank from it right away."
"These are absolutely HORRIBLE for anyone who has any level of curvy body size 8 and up.  Don‚Äôt waste your time or your money, don‚Äôt even size up! They fabric is terrible, the fit is horrendous.  Highly highly disappointed"
"Had to install a cat door for the lower level where the litter box is once the dog developed a taste for the ahem...Perfect for my Savannah cats! No frills, easy to install and looks perfect.Install tip: Use a jigsaw, not a multi tool."
"Cute and fun, but finishing not good for the half of the pieces. My son still loves and plays with that, so it's not a total loss. He plays with the set for a couple of hours EVERY day. Just wish the pieces had not broken so easily."
"I have cars that go on the track and one I built from the ground up, piece by piece, All the Bling. I put these shocks on and it looked awesome! So I will say these shocks worked out file for me."
Perfect fit for the larger size chihuahua. The mesh makes the harness less abrasive than just the strap ones. Velcro holds firmly and if a good size. The leash rings are larger than the small or extra small. So you will need the extra strap that comes with the leashes.
"Okay so the Dose Lockers work great and they were perfect for the price. That being said, when I received my two-pack I noticed that half of the paint on both units had peeled off in the bag.Not really a big deal functionally, but I was a little disappointed."
This dress is beautiful and the material is great. I read reviews that it ran big so I got a large and it was a little too big so I returned it. If I would've ordered a medium it would have been perfect!
I wanted to love this shirt...the pattern was beautiful and the shirt fit nicely except the tie in the front is very awkward.  It does not go all the way up to your stomach like the picture...sadly I had to return.
"Almost a 5-star, but I had to modify the top pole-locks as they tend to slip with the weight of the banner, dropping a few inches through the day. A layer of gaffers tape inside the lock of the holder helps... but shouldn't need to do this."
"The pieces are all uniquely shaped, they are coated, so they‚Äôre a little bit shiny, very good quality, they have letters on the back of them in case you really can‚Äôt find out where it goes. I was really impressed. Lots of fun to build."
Not ideal that you must fold these yourself however looking at the photo instructions on the product page I was able to do so. Overall they are decent for the price point and folding while an extra step helps keep the cost down on shipping.
"I bought this thinking my GF would need it for an ankle injury.  Her ankle had recovered by the day it arrived.  It looks like a nice unit, well made, easily assembled.  I was able to return it easily."
Bracelets are pretty but very disappointed bc of the sizing. I bought these for my 11 yr old daughter and most of them were too loose when the string was fully tied. Same for myself as an adult trying to wear them :(
I bought it to give it a better taste to my milk but you hardly taste the cinammon.  I think its just okay.  I rather stick to my vanilla and cinnamon vs this product.  I did not feel a boost of energy or nothing.
Took awhile to train but it makes me feel better that the dog can get water in the summer heat. My dog loves playing with the water coming out of the hose so to have control when it comes out is pretty awesome in her eyes!
"It is a nice belt buckle, but I was expecting much darker color (almost black), similar to the one in the product picture. Buckle does look like its description, i.e. &#34;Antique Copper Finish&#34;, just not what I expected and not what I was looking for."
"I love this brush! While brushing out a dog‚Äôs coat I don‚Äôt have to stop n clean the brush with a comb, with the click of a button I can just shake the hair off with a flick of the wrist and keep going!"
Love it although the chains get tangled. Ordered a second one because I wore tje first so much that it turned to rust. No im lovin wearin the second although I only ewar it with specific shirts cause I want this one yo last alot longer!
"I ordered these but didn't need to install right away.  When I did finally need to install them, the Magenta cartridge would not work.  The other 2 worked fine.  It was 2 days past the return date and so I was out of luck."
I loved this card.  It was super simple yet stated so much in a very cute and playful way.  I would buy again the next time I am missing one of my dear friends.  :)  Highly recommend.
"Yes, I have big calves, but according to the measurements, I ordered the largest size and these were highly inappropriate to call compression socks, I think mainly because of the designs. There was not enough stretch and they cut right into me, causing more damage than good"
"That's a nice drone. It's already prepared to use with naked GoPro. And yes, quad, naked GoPro 6, and 3s Li-Hv 720-850mAh are still under 250g. Frame is strong, but not heavy. I really like it. Pyrodrone sells it cheaper, but still doesn't have in stock."
The tie keeps ripping from the bag when you pull to close the bag. The texture of the bag is also not pliable and is very crinkly. It also rips off the roll in an unusual way. Do not buy this product.
These are some warm ass jogging pants. They are very thick and I'm hoping they don't shrink. The pockets are nice and they are very well made and they are very very warm. Oh and did I mention they are warm.
This is such a comprehensive book. I enjoyed learning the history of bourbon-so many facts I was unaware of. These distilleries are sure lucky to be a part of this book. If you are visiting Kentucky this is a great resource.
Love this jacket. It‚Äôs light weight but still protects from cold wind. The only reason I didn‚Äôt rate 5 stars is it came fairly wrinkled and wrinkles easy when you wash it. It just needs special care but is worth it!
"I like the fact that there are two of each of the lounging areas. (Two hammocks, two cubbies, and two mats) Both of my cats can sleep in their hammocks without needing to push the other out. They also enjoy the scratch posts, and so does my furniture."
This shampoo smells great and I feel good about using it on my dogs. This product line is gentle on my dogs sensitive skin. it does a great job getting my dog clean. Can't wait to try more of these shampoos in this line out.
I wanted a larger chess set with decently weighted pieces.  For the price this set exceeded my expectations.  4&#34; King and every piece has a nice weighted feel.  Would strongly consider giving one as a gift if I had a chess player on my gift list.
"durable, small and delightful. it is so cute and sparkly. you can't see all the sparkles on the pictures. just big enough to hold your cell phone and small personal items needed for a date night. love it is worth the price"
"Great medium weight sweater to wear over or under other layers. (I'd go up to wear over a tee.)  They keep a rich black color through many washings, and they maintain their shape well. The material is very soft. These are my favorites mid weights over several other brands."
"New computer deployment of HP Mini desktops in a school was great except no one could easily find the power button.  Problem solved.They are small enough, big enough, visual enough to mark what needs marked.  And you get a ton of them lol."
"Our grandson loves these new toys in his sandbox! Buckets for water, shovels for moving and digging, it has been great to just sit outside in the shade and watch him play. Great investment and great memories!! Lots of shapes, sizes and tools for hours of play."
One cartridge (the black) kept giving me a bad warning &#34;shipping tab needs to be removed.&#34; I removed it before I put it into the printer. The cyan leaves a blue streak on the paper. I have ordered new cartridges and will replace it and throw it away.
"This is a great multifunction calculator, but check the size before you order. I looked at the image and decided it was perhaps 3 - 4"" wide, when it is actually 6"" wide. Functions as perfectly as one would expect from a Casio product, but it seems about one-and-a-half scale..."
Awesome very cute and chic I bought this to wear with a summer dress for my next trip gives it just enough jazz to complete my outfit love the best fits great I'm busty and purchased xxl which fit perfect
This is good for teaching the alphabet. We really like Melissa & Doug. This is a nice puzzle. It is a very cute. The pieces are good quality. They are nice and thick. My child enjoyed putting it together. They fit together well. We were pleased and would recommend.
My daughter added this to her Christmas wishlist.  I have never seen this before. She‚Äôs into princesses and animals so thought this would be perfect. It‚Äôs bigger than I thought. It‚Äôs really cute and great for pretend play. High quality. Great for a gift. My daughter is 5.
"I have had two of these for at least a year. Mine work great! I have two inside dogs and I live on a small farm. Lots of dirt in my laundry. These are cheap and need nothing replaced, recharged, etc. I‚Äôm getting more to give to my daughters."
"It took forever to get this  had no idea it was coming from Korea. Then to makes matters worse, we plugged it in and it NEVER even got warm.....light  on the control button went on that was all that worked on it."
The capsule smell disgusting. I did not see any difference in my body performance by taking 2 capsule per day. Learned a lesson that not to spend money on some fancy useless product that just make false claim and nothing more.
Finicky eating cat who has wasted a lot of money by turning her nose up to most traditional cat foods.  Nice variety and I am not going broke trying to keep the little (20 lbs.) princess happy.  ‚ù§üêæ
"Meh....not very good product. I needed it for a decorating contest at work, so it served its purpose, but don't expect it to not fall apart within an hour of opening it and hanging it up. I guess for $5, you really get what you pay for."
"This is a cute bag but it's much smaller than the pics make it out to be. Since the material is very hard, you cant squeeze anything in so it really only holds a phone, a lipstick and one of those card holders, no wallet."
Absolute garbage.  The glow sticks barely worked. 50% of each kit up if they.  They were impossible to fit in the glasses and there were no fasteners to make bracelets.  Worst thing I ever purchased on Amazon
"These are great mini quadcopter.  We now have three of them in the house and havent had many issues.  Get extra rotors you will need them from time to time if you are careful.  they are great indoor fliers, and outside the range is amazing."
We were using them for sanding trim during a remodel. We have used several brands of steelwool in the past and not had this experience. The residue that came off left behind a layer of silver so we stopped using.
Loved it - loaded it up (but not over loaded) and zipper broke the VERY first time I went to use it (the day before my trip) and then unfortunately I missed the return window (my fault).  Do not recommend.
I put a star because I couldn't write a review with out the star. But I super mad because I received the book without the CD or pendrive and without that you can not use the program. So I feel stolen. I want my money back.
"I bought this for my Grandnephew for Christmas.  Well, I got a better review than Santa.  It made his Christmas.  My sister bought a hat, cape and a Magic Wand it was also a kit.  If you have a 5-7-year-old get it all!"
Flavor is good. Will get again.Update: I‚Äôve since bought this pre workout multiple times. It has the right ingredients for my liking to make for an energy-rich and long lasting exercise. I especially like the flavor- it tastes like Pez candies imo.
"the only problem we had with this is when we received it, it had batteries in it already - and they were corroded.  we were worried that it wouldn't work but it did.  my nephew loves this and sleeps with it. it is very cute and soft."
i just purchase this fan just last week and today i try into my dji mavic air to fix my overheating problem about after changing out the old one the issue still remain.I am certify it technician and my experience tell me that the motherboard has not detecting the fan
"my son loves playing the lego games, and he was introduced to juggernaut this way. he loved this gift for his birthday, and loves taking it apart and putting it back together. he's 6 and it's very easy for him to take off and put back together."
"honestly it works really well. I was actually surprised by how well it worked. It does extend your lashes and when you apply mascara on top of it, it looks super long ! I love it ! Very easy to use no complaints"
The keys are fantastic! great weight and look to them - they were the hit of the event! They arrived on time and packaged carefully. I would definitely recommend buying these if you're looking for a great keepsake for your guests!
"The most bang for your buck! This straightener heats up quickly and works great on my curly, thick hair. It also comes with awesome accessories; comb/glove & two clips to help with styling. Don't second guess it, just BUY IT!"
Waste of money. Not durable or waterproof at all. Two dogs used it on day one and pee went straight through it and the poop is stuck to it. Not any easy clean up. I wasted my money on this
the elastic cuts off your circulation to the painful part ..and don't even bother trying to wash you dishes with super hot water ...zero heat resistance might as well not wear them at all ....  I cut the sleeves off and used them for gardening
"...they have also corrected a great many INCORRECT dates that they had in the initial printings - very fun game for kids, but if everything goes to plan the game should become less and less challenging each time played, as the dates are remembered."
"We have a rescue resort for abused seniors or rescues with medical issues.  All of our pet family (past and present) love these treats.  They must be very tasty.  We twist the treats in half so they last longer.  Thanks, AA"
"Excellent product but to wear out I believe it would be impossible under dress clothes, but to wear around the house it does the job. I would recommend it for use in and around the house for anyone. Thank you"
"This is a classic component that is virtually identical to the one I remember having as a child. Well built, and the string is sufficiently sturdy to withstand the tugs that my toddler inevitably tried before understanding how the wheel worked."
"We are using the pins to mark all of the places on a world map that we had visited.  Each family member has a specific color and if the family visited, together, that is a specific family pin color.  Lots of fun and look great on the map."
These make it so much easier to paint my dogs nails. The colors are ok i just wish there was a hot pink. They dry super super fast! The only bad thing is the marker started to get a little dry by the time I was done.
"There was nothing wrong with the product, I had ordered them before but didn't realize there were 2 different sizes.  My mistake, I ordered wrong size, but I was shocked to see the amount they charge to return them, especially after I ordered the correct size!  Not happy."
"I really like this ring, not to big or to small.  The rose gold is very pretty. It's a statement piece. If you have short finger it not the bestring for you. It not good for the ring to over power your hand. True to the picture."
Got my Sumo back up and running in quick fashion. first repair i have made and it didnt take very long at all to fix. These parts fit exactly as originals and its nice to have some extra parts laying around incase of another break.
I took mat out of box and put it right back in. I didn't want to wait for days for the mat to flatten. I think it would have been great. Just should ship in flat box so customer will be pleased.
"Ordered this for my daughter‚Äôs Halloween-themed birthday party. Fit as expected. Somewhat shiny/stretchy material, lightweight, and ideal for busty women who don‚Äôt want cleavage showing, in my opinion. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äù 140 lbs and 34D; the medium was perfect‚Äîcould have done a small too, if I wanted a more fitted dress."
Really great stuff. I used it on my foot after I had a good size cut. Once I saw how good it worked i brought it to a 4 day music festival that I do first aid for. It was perfect for keeping bandaids gauze etc on moving bodies.
"Very good hentai title . The product description outlines the plot pretty good so I won't rehash it . The artwork in this one is excellent , the girls are very cute . If you only buy 1 groper hentai , then this is it , it's that good ."
It‚Äôs a great dress I super love it but it‚Äôs definitely a date night dress for me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and the slot in the front opens up pretty often and shows all the legs. Which isn‚Äôt bad just not work appropriate for me.
Doesn‚Äôt look like the photo- the pendant looks like it is printed paper and the metal and chain look like bad cheap metal. These were inexpensive but should at least look look the picture . I certainly can't give them as gifts or wear it.
"Needed this to trim down a couple of stray nuisance hairs that keep recurring. This little clipper does the trick in a matter of seconds. It runs on a single AAA battery, which lasts quite a while. Nice little gadget."
"...my Co worker hates me cuz his lil boy loves it and its the first thing he graps in the morning. He said it is a noisy toy, but a great one cuz HIS SON LOVES IT!!!!! and I guess that's what counts!!!!!"
We are repeat buyers of this paper. We use it to print invoices for our small business. The pattern is clear but light enough to not interfere with the printing. We don‚Äôt have any problem with bunching up in the printer or tearing. We would buy again. Prompt shipping.
"This is a very well made and high quality shirt that is sized appropriately.  Comes packaged in a single clear plastic wrap, so it does need ironing once you receive it.  Ironing is very easy on this shirt and it the colors do not fade after many washes."
"Once I installed the black ink cartridge my printer suddenly stopped printing color ink, all of which are genuine brother ink. Before using this cartridge I was using a genuine black ink cartridge from brother and had no issues until replacing it with EZ compatible ink. Returned."
This is the only thing that takes away the throbbing pain in my knee and hip from Bursitis  It even helped the knot in my shoulder the other day fromSleeping wrong. Great stuff. I have a bottle stashed everywhere
"I have 2 boxer puppies who are not fully house trained yet....so whenever they have an accident I just spray it on the spot, let it set a few minutes...then I scrub the spot up. Pretty easy and effective, the odor is gone! Love this product!"
"Thought these would be so cute for Easter! The bow came off the pink one in 2 weeks (it was held on by glue) I am going to sew back on myself, but I wish it had stayed on the first time!"
After sending my watch back for factory repairs that were ineffective I replaced the battery and the watch has been working fine ever since. It seems important to charge the battery using led lamps as the sun method is too hot.
"I ordered the green in a XL and I am 5ft 7 and it fit my curves well! It is a gorgeous bright grass green color. The stiching and overall build of the dress is wonderful, and I cannot wait to wear it to my next event im invited to!"
"Basic shampoo, didn't really help the flea problem long term... just in the moment, which soaking your pups in water will do too.  Smell was nice, but quickly faded after blow drying the dogs.Wont buy again, much better shampoos and flea items out there."
"I needed a small scale that is easy to use, easy to clean, and can be calibrated/certified for use at my farm stand. I looked at a lot of scales, and this one fit the bill. I've been using it for several months, and I still love it."
This worked out beautifully on an inside doorway so that I could roll my husband in his wheelchair into the next room. It‚Äôs heavy enough just to lie in front of the raised threshold with out anything to secure it down. Nice looking too.
"My coworker is obsessed with Jason Momoa so this was a perfect gift for her!  I'd comment more, however I don't think she's the type to open these figures (keeps them in the box).  From what I could see it has Great detail.  Nicely sized figurine."
I love this clippers. It's easy to use and very efficient to remove the hairs on my golden retrievers paws. I used to use scissors but the clipper works much better. The trimming is more smooth than scissors cut. Great stuff!
"Transported my cat from Saudi to the USBag was easy to carry, fit under seat easily and she seemed comfortable (beware and try out first as her sibling was able to push the screen open - I used zip ties on the all the doors except too and front)"
This is really handy. I paid extra for plastic sleeve...and SOMEONE put their big ol' sticker right in the middle of the clear plastic sleeve. That sleeve does NO good if you have to take the chart out everytime to be able to read the information...dah
"I like the silicone grip, but the clippers are weak and don't always fully cut through fairly thin/normal fingernails. I also am missing having the little nail file that often comes with these, because it's handy for cleaning under the nails."
"Very thin material...flimsy. I originally purchased these as "" photo protectors"" to enclose in larger envelopes sent through the mail. However, I don't feel confident using these, as they are so thin, I know the photos would probably end up damaged/ bent."
"I have a rather large, sloppy labrador who always made a mess when taking a drink of water. These new dishes are deeper than the average dish and I have noticed that there is less of a water mess surrounding the dish area than in the past."
So I SWORE I wasn't gonna be one of those dog owners who spluged on things like this. I was even going to return it after ordering......Then I tried it on my black poodle mix. She looks beautiful. We will definitely be adding more RC Pet collars to her collection.
"This is an amazing jacket. I was looking at it for at least 4 months. I saw it drop from $190 to $90. I am glad I waited, and I am not disappointed by the purchase. You can tell the quality."
"I bought these ears for WoW Cosplay and I really love them.  The make-up is only a small amount, maybe enough for just face and markings, so Buying some more latex paint is a plus.  But the ears stay on good with a stretchy string."
The two small drawers are just a little bit too wide. Wide enough so that they won't open idependently. Have to hold on to the frame every time I open a small drawer otherwise they both open at the same time. Will try sanding down the sides.
"I received less clothes than I ordered.  They did refund me $5.  However, make sure you count what you receive to make sure you get what you pay for.  The clothes seem to be ok, nothing fantastic."
Really surprised by the amzing quality and and assembly.  No glue required and it all went together with no issues!  More than one tables worth of terrain for most players. Plays WTC terrain layouts perfectly. I 100% recommend this terrain.
"Great, looks exactly as advertised. Just one thing- the zipper isn't made very well. The zip keeps getting stuck underneath at the ends and so I have to carefully pinch it whenever I zip it close. The zipper should've been more secured."
My mother is starting to get dementia.  She was enjoying the sticker books but I wanted to get her something different.  She really enjoyed making the Jewerly box.  With her arthritis she was able to remove the stickers and place them on the box without any difficulty.
I took the regular E-Fem product for a year and really like  the energy and boost in my libido. THis product has all that with greater long-lasting effects. I will continue to purchase. Can't beat Amazon's online price. About had the cost of health food stores.
"My daughter loves her hat. It is so pretty, it weighs nothing and dries fast. I really recommend to buy this product for your kids. The delivery it was also so fast!  I am waiting now for a second hat for my little daughter. :)"
I am left handed and I ordered these because they have the removable finger rest. They came as right handed shears with a permanent finger rest I couldn't take off which made it very uncomfortable to even attempt to use.
"Needed ink; rather inject than buy ink cartridges for an older printer. Very good quality ink, especially the black. Instantly dries on paper after printing. It does the job. Would've liked a syringe in the package so I had to improvise, but all in all, no real complaints."
"Great item for comic collectors. No bull I put one sheet in front , middle and back.  This is a must have. I purchased some from eBay a year ago in my Giant size X-Men and no smell. Buy this stuff."
"We tested one out before giving the rest to our son for Christmas.... it was stuck to our ceiling for 5hrs and when we tried to knock it down, it just crawled across the ceiling. We literally had to PULL it off!!"
"My first 6 inch stormtrooper. I like it very much. The cape is a little meh, but it is soft goods so that comes as no surprise. He poses very well. The box was beat to crap and back but I am no longer an  in-the-box-collector."
"Munchkin: Apocalypse fan (like I am)? Then BUY THIS. :-) It's worth it for the &#34;Martian flying saucer&#34; disasters alone. It has a couple of new &#34;seals&#34; in it too, and it's a great homage to the classic &#34;Mars Attacks!&#34; 1950s-era collector cards."
A great book for understanding the healing power of Wheatgrass especially concerning  pets.  I've recommended it for two friends with dogs with cancer.  A must read for anyone interested in cleaning their body of toxins and battling disease.
Used it for about two weeks and then my toothbrush started to randomly turn itself on in the middle of the night and go through all the settings like it‚Äôs possessed. Now I can‚Äôt use it because it doesn‚Äôt work when you need it to
"[[VIDEOID:6c4a0d32bec6bafdcc8ef08effa527e0]] My daughter loves this thing. It makes a pretty chime noise the weird monster bug crinkles, as well as one ear of the bear and his tail: if pulled makes the bear vibrate. The ice cream cone comes off and makes a fun thing to throw and rattle"
"Its so cute and a great price, something he will be able to wear for a while. He was 8 lbs almost 9 at birth, it fit a little big but we brought him home from the hospital in this !"
"The only thing I wish the would change is put the stick-em on the envelop vice on the flap.  If you need to change out an item, you end up with the stick-em on the items unless you are very careful & fold the flap over before replacement."
"El pedido llego bien y completo, sin embargo, al llenar el recipiente con el gel antibacterial y colocar el tap√≥n, se sale el gel por los lados y se unde el tap√≥n.... es enredado su uso y no es muy pr√°ctico."
"I purchased two tubes.  One showed black marks on the outside, suggesting impurities.  Outside finish was rough and tube was so thick and rigid that insertion was painful.  As another reviewer mentioned, this product seems more suited for mechanical functions such as cleaning out a carburetor."
"Smells nice but total ripoff $7.99 for a 2.5oz....when you can get a 7oz bottle for a dollar more. My fault should've read teh description. PLUS the picture with all the bottles is misleading, you would think you were getting 6-7 mini cans for $7.99.. But again my fault.."
"The OD of 1/2"" pipe is 0.84"" or 21.3mm.  The ID of these fittings are 20mm.  So I had to heat the pipe up to squeeze it into the fitting.It worked but the item was not listed very clearly."
"Pay attention to size it‚Äôs 11‚Äù but worth the money,side note U have to use the suction cups because it floats so keep that in mind if you have sand in the tank and you want it on the bottom faceing up lol"
"Bought it for my daughter and she loved it, the opening allowed her ponytail to be out and it looks cute. Totally worth the price. the slouch was also cute, fits my head too so i can borrow it. It is warm and comfortable."
"I bought 2 of these for my girls. They are legit Disney plushes. They are cute, soft. Not funny-looking in any way. Only thing is one of the two came without a thumb, but my toddler doesn't notice or care."
"Love it, and so do my dogs.  Didn't have much in the way of assembly instructions, but it was so simple it was quite easy to figure out.  It will also easily go from stroller to trailer with little effort."
"Some poop bags are hard to tear apart at the perforatIon, not these one. I have a large dog and these bags are good size and have never had any unwanted tear issues while picking up. Plus, it makes me feel good that they will breakdown eventually."
The battery hatch has to be screwed in with a tiny screwdriver.  I was able to look passed that.  Stopped working after a almost 2 hours of really infrequent use.  No one should abide by that and an annoying battery hatch.
"I am a real estate agent and was looking for some simple stationery to reach out to my customer base. I loved these cards because I wanted something with ""home"" on the front. They're good quality and a great value for the price. Would recommend!"
"I like this calendar because all of the pictures are Australian Shepherd puppies.  Another brand used to make a mini calendar that always used to have pictures of puppies, but now just is mainly adult dogs so I was glad to find  this calendar."
"I've only had the scissors for a couple of months. Past scissor purchases started out sharp, but quickly became so dull they were no longer useable. So I decided to pay more for better quality. This scissor is lightweight, easy to hold, and sharp. It's cute too. ü§û"
"I loved the fact that the rods were pre-bent, that the hardware for the ends matches the rod perfectly.  Everything came packaged in a high quality clear plastic enclosed box that was easy to open but stayed properly closed when normally being handled."
"These CLEARLY stated, that they were MADE IN USA, along with materials, etc... sourced in USA...First thing upon getting them, right on the package itself:MADE IN CHINA!!!The company out right LIED about their product.The quality is TRASH too.DONT BUY IT"
Very tight on the arms and shoulders. Got pretty small (even though I ordered my size). VERY SEE THROUGH. The back you can see everything but the front is too see through to go braless unless you are wearing nipple covers...
"Everything about this figure is cool.Besides the fact that Hasbro could've made this figure with a head and face and not just the helmet.A great addition to a clone collection, even though he is just Rex in a different color..."
"Wouldn‚Äôt fit on my arms way too small at 187lbs I think it should have fit. But no way plus was not gonna force it. Not true to size, I really loved the look of this top in the photo. My arms aren‚Äôt even that big!"
This was thinner than I thought it would be which actually worked out as the dog who is wearing it is a bit dainty. He totally seems like the type to be on a yacht somewhere so it fits his whole image well.
"My kitten loves his tower. The various scratching areas are wonderful as are the hanging toys. His favorite spot, when not on my lap, is at the very top (where he is safe from our two year old granddaughter‚Äôs many hugs lol)."
"I absolutely love this product! And I think you would too. I have a little difficult of finding the one that would fit my printer, but that was the only thing. I use a lot of printer ink, and it's still going strong!"
Although the dress is nice itself.  I didn't like the length nor how the dress draped on my body. It flared out a little too much for me.  I already have wide hips and fit like a moo moo on me. Returned it.
We got this for my son for his 4th birthday. He‚Äôs had a lot of fun building with these! We had to buy a different container to hold them and some straws bend too easily. Other than that it‚Äôs a great toy!
Very happy with these table covers. They are thicker and stronger than most other 1-time-use covers and the colors are nice and vibrant. It's a 3-pack and each one is individually wrapped. They were perfect for our Oktoberfest party we had!  Will definitely buy again for next year's event!
"Bought this for my wife at her request as her 2020 planner. Very nice, large pages and the paper is heavier than some so more sturdy. A bit large, but works well on a desk and is easily transported in a backpack or briefcase."
So I got these as I thought it was a good deal as is most Amazon purchased items.  The first cleaning head lasted two days and the second didn‚Äôt make it through Thanksgiving Day.  Sponge became detached from plastic part.  Not such a good deal.
funky smell went away quickly. great color. fits perfectly. nice slouch. not exactly made for cold weather but perfect for fall or summer nights on the beach in California.note: my daughter stole this one from me while visiting. I loved it enough to reorder. raised rating to 5‚≠ê.
"Received at approximately 12:00 noon; photo taken within 15 minutes of start of playing with ball. My dig is not a big chewer. Do not waste your money on this product. I do not normally write reviews, but people need to know that this is not a good product"
I‚Äôm currently a full time college student and I have my desk all set up but I bought this for when I wanna sit in bed or on the couch for class/homework and it‚Äôs perfect. Everything I need is right there and it‚Äôs compact and portable.
"The purse is very attractive.  I liked that it was stiff and would hold its shape well.  Unfortunately, I had barely put anything in it before the lining tore.  Perhaps it was just a bad seam.  I might reorder it to try it again."
"This product has been perfect for what we needed! We have a teething puppy and a 2 year old, so this has helped them play without any injuries! Our pup doesn‚Äôt seem to mind the muzzle at all, in fact she brings it to us to put on her sometimes!"
"This is a great product and a great way to store bows. My bows always get damaged, sitting around in a box from year to year. This way, you have a fresh ironed bow when you need it without it being crushed."
Great deal! All the pens work! And the detail is phenomenal. Get these you won't regret them. I gifted some for friends and family and they were impressed. They glide and the stroke is effortless. Wish they come in more designs.
"wasnt impressed with the quality. the buttons jingle like a cheap kids toy, and the button holes were already visibily falling apart upon reciept of the item. i ordered a size up and it was still small, so im pretty disappointed."
Perfect little outdoor pen for my baby red footed tortoise! She/He loves it on warm days! Easy to put together by using instructions. Better if two people can put it together instead of by oneself.Extremely happy with the purchase and highly recommend as a tortoise pen.
"There is nothing cheap about this product. Contained everything listing said it would have.  Bristles on brush are soft but not to soft, and the smell of the toothpaste was okay. The price was okay also. Oh yeah most important of all it works- whitens the teeth."
"I am experienced and have used different products for my planted aquariums. Always been a fan of Nutrifin but did not know they had this until I found it on Amazon. This is great stuff, all natural, and my plants are growing very well. Thanks Hagen and Amazon!"
Love this harness it's one tough harness. Couple of different attachment options and in a situation a couple of handles to grab your dog. I can the only thing I would improve would be metal clasp. Bad side of that it would increase the cost.
"I was unlucky once and lost my original finders key chain. I was so excited to find another one at such a great price. One of my best Christmas gifts! Great for big purses. Keeps keys handy, so no more digging!"
Very lovely dress and well made.  The size fit as I expected.  I am busty so I ordered a size up and it fit very well!  Two of the larger beads fell off during my event or I would give this a 5 star rating.
"I am obsessed with this relax straight fit jean that literally is the perfect fit all around! Love the length, way it hugs my butt and hips, rise, and amount of distress details. Super comfortable and flattering all around. I ended up ordering a 2nd pair!"
Quality appears to have gone down.  Not as thick and developed holes quickly.  These socks use to be super thick but comfortable and last forever. A pack I bought 2 years ago are in better shape then the pack i bought 3 months ago though....
"I ordered these as a party favor in goody bags. Each whistle came wrapped in tight plastic and in good shape. For the price, I wasnt expecting much but these are a decent size and had great sound! Pleasantly surprised and a hit with the kids! Would recommend"
The ingredients on the highly advertised Exipure for weight loss are not the same as the Exipure on Amazon.  Go to Exipure.com to see the real product.  Amazon's Exipure is basically a Ketosis product made by various manufactures.
I've tried numerous products to stop my dog's urine from yellowing the lawn.  This is the first one I have found that really works.  I break up the tablet (they are scored) and put them in my dog's food.
Both dogs are fighting over who gets to sleep in this bed now.  It is fluffy and cozy without making my terriers hot.  Shipping takes a longggg time but it is coming from overseas in UK and has beautiful fabric and craftsmanship. It is worth it.
"This is a mini Tapasty type material. So using tape to the back of your tank will be a challenge. I used double sided Velcro strips across the top. Over all it is very detailed, looks good, thicker material, and really looks nice as a backdrop."
"This necklace is about the size of a dime and very lightweight. I love how dainty it is. You can't tell they are the scales of justice unless you are really close up. But I kind of like the subtle reminder just for me, unless I share it with others."
The roller is not very easy to use as the fabric needs to stay still and flat when rolling but I do like the little tools that come with it. I use it to clean many surfaces when my cats have been playing on.
"This product has as much adhesion as scotch tape.... It does not stick to carpet, cement, or even indoor solid floor that well at all. It is advertising that they are for the floor, but do not seem to work for the floor..."
The space where the batteries go was not as it should have been - batteries could not fit and toy never worked. Santa brought this to my daughter... he should have checked the packaging first. VERY dissapointed DO NOT RECCOMEND
I‚Äôm not that busty and this thing no where near fit my bust. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm very hippy and it fit my hips just fine but not my bust at all . Typical scratchy thin China fabric too which would‚Äôve been ok for price if it would‚Äôve near fit
My Cockatoo loves to take things apart. She's even taken her cage apart twice!  This toy kept her occupied for about 2 weeks til she figure out she can unscrew the outside screws and make it drop to the floor. Once it's on the floor it's ignored
"Great value for the price. Perfect for your kids poppy costume. The wig is soft and comfortable enough that the kids will keep it on... may be a bit big for a toddlers head but could easily fit with a beanie, hood, or hat underneath."
"We bought those for our cat that suffers from anxiety, but it doesn't seem to work.  Have not seen a change in our cat.  No change in her behavior.  Wouldn't get again.  The cat doesn't seem to mind it on, so that's a plus."
"Product arrived on time & in great shape. Beautiful hot pink color & quality envelope. This color won't get lost & will stand out on a desk full of regular craft envelopes. Particularly great for attracting attention to your resume', etc."
My niece loved these.  She wore them for Halloween.  I was kinda surprised how well the stood up to a three year old.  She fell at one point and they didn‚Äôt tear.  That‚Äôs a great product in my book..
I have a broad back. I'm not able to even grab the adjusters so I know for men this really isnt for them. Maybe for a kid under the age of 12. But board backs... sadly look for something else.
On the days when my right knee is really swollen and hurting I wear the bamboo knee support. It is very firm but not restricting for daytime usage: at night it is too restricting for me.  Of course Amazon delivery was superb
Absolutely amazing! Bought a $3 pump for balloons that worked really well. The confetti glitter didn‚Äôt fall to the bottom. I switched the numbers for a ‚ÄúSweet 61‚Äù party. The Happy Birthday sign was so lovely! It only took 15 mins to set it all up!
Great picture! This was given as a Christmas gift and the recipient loved it! It's hard to find puzzles that have really pretty scenes. There are lots of colors and will be a challenge for completion -- great for anyone looking to add a new puzzle to their collection.
"This was a fun and challenging puzzle.  The pieces aren't fully interlocking and are a bunch of crazy shapes and sizes, so it's a bit more ambitious than a lot of puzzles, but we enjoyed working on it.  The pieces are nice and sturdy."
The pockets are up high and it is an awkward placement. One of the pockets had not been stitched correctly and had a hole in it. I liked the sleeves and the high neck. The material was not too thin.
I would give these zero stars if I could. So horribly cheap. We tried them on the first time and they immediately pulled apart from the clasps. I thought maybe it was just a fluke and tried the others and they did the same thing. Do not buy these.
Picture shows several cats enjoying this tree.  They must be tiny cats.  Tree is smaller than it appears and has odd levels difficult for cats to climb.  I used about half the tree and configured my own setup.
"They work great,so many ways to use them like putting it on your hand to clean a ceiling fan !I already bought some for a friend who has dog's and hardwood floors,plus I gave a set to my neighbor neighbor for the same reason."
"this peel is very strong!! i would strongly suggest you add it a lotion such as cerave moisturizing lotion. i didn't dilute it the first time i used it and it burned my face in about 30 seconds. the frost was immediate, so be careful!"
"my cat loves this box, but think the product is very pricey to just be torn up.  I found a cheap replacement scratcher that I cut to size, because the box is still in decent shape and fits perfectly where I put it.Designs on boxes are very cute."
"For the price, material wasn‚Äôt to bad but the cut was not good. I order the extra large as it was suppose to be at 16/18, and that was not even close to the right size. Way to small. I‚Äôm normally a 14."
Love them. Definitely a statement as they are oversized. They cover up a huge portion of your face while still showing off your eyebrows (if u wear them a bit lower than usual.) Debating if i should buy even another pair.
The only one of the 4 heads that I can use is the interdental cleaner which I like very much. I just don't like to have to purchase the other three items along with the interdental cleaners. Could these be sold separately? Thanks
"It's a good liner for dog owners. The velcro strips won't stick on the plastic interior, so the side panels will come off. It's best if you just make grommet holes and tie the side panels so they won't droop downwards."
"Works great, I live in South Texas(also called Hell in the summer) so there is nothing that will keep me sweat-free here but this cap does a great job keeping the sweat out of my eyes and off my glasses when I road cycle for 1-2 hours a day...thanks!"
"The toy was great in that it had a lot ofactivities for our baby as well as varied sounds and colors. I bought it mostly for the drum, which served it's purpose. I would have liked it to be a little bigger, but for a smaller baby it was fine."
"Not the measurements stated, I needed bigger ones for my shirt because the pair I have come out too easily, I measured mine and got these because they said they were 10 mm wide, when they are 8 mm wide, nice looking, but smaller than stated"
The product is great.  It help to clean the back and parts of the body you cannot reach.  Leaving your skin clean and soft.  It help to get rid of acne and dead skin from the back.
"Absolutely the best nightie a person could ask for. It is so soft, fits great, and I love the style. In fact, I am back here looking for a few more nightgowns from the same company in a bit of a different style and/or color. They are awesome!"
"Hoova rated this 6200 mAH, it gives me less run time then my other 5000mAH batteries.  Also strange this supposed bigger battery weighs less then my 5000 batteries.  It feels like Hoova makes you pay for unreal numbers.  I call BS on 6200mAH, 100C."
"Shipping took a couple weeks, but got what I expected for price. Surprisingly it‚Äôs lined and not see through. I could‚Äôve ordered a smaller size but I always ordered the largest size just because these things tend to run small"
"Best deck of cards I've ever owned. At first, you might think, $20 for a deck of cards?! But each card is unique and stocked with incredibly deep permaculture info. Make sure you buy the deck from Paul Wheaton... not the knock-off clones that have been floating around."
I use it for my power washing business it‚Äôs easy to use and shoots real far to get at those peaks. Plus I use it to apply chemical to my siding jobs gets to those hard to reach places. Very good product.
This is a BEAUTIFUL Bobo Bird watch! Looks just like the photo. The wood is lightweight and smells great. And the black face dresses it up and makes it look extra handsome. Also comes in a nice bamboo box for gift giving.
"Not sure why this is called Light Green Stone, it looks like a blue grey color to me.  But it's pretty and the chain and pendant seem to be fairly sturdy.  It's very pretty, but I'm not sure if I will purchase again"
"Our daughter turned us onto this product and because we take so many road trips it's become our ""don't leave home without it"" item. Works great and our little buddy loves drinking out of it. This is a FIVE STAR product."
I have tried mini fly boots on my Arabian mare. These stay on they stay up and they fit her well. And they work. They keep the flies off her legs. Before getting these boots to Phys we‚Äôre just eating her legs up.
Way too hard and rough on the dogs. It rips their fur out. I am going to donate it. My puppies said I should throw it away. The concept was a nice thought.SAVE YOUR MONEY.  DON'T BUY THIS UNLESS YOU WANT TO TORTURE YOUR DOG!
This was ordered for a friend who has a dog with spina bifida. It helps him tremendously with protecting his skin and lower half from scooting around. It is a necessity to have when he's not set up with his wheels
"I was looking for something to hold all the little bits and pieces and this container works great. I have a few options instead of just dumping all in a bin.  It is compact, holds alot, and arrived as promised."
My cat treats it like a toy.  She pushes it around the room because it slides easily and is lightweight.  She plays with the bottle because it is shiny and reflects the light.  It also comes out of the dish easily and the water spills.
I don‚Äôt usually write these but I thought I should note that the description says it comes with a remote control and it does not come with  a remote  control in the box! at least mine didn‚Äôt . Such a bummer.
"I am 5'8 and 225 lbs, I ordered a 2x, I was looking for a tighter & heavier spandex. Not what this is. They were comfortable in the hip/butt and loose on the waist. I took in the waist myself. The bants are long enough and comfortable."
"A birthday gag gift... but I guess the joke's on me! My friend loves using this as a stress ball and finds a ton of entertainment in throwing it around. It's about the size of a soft ball, perhaps a little bit bigger, and on the heavier side of things."
These boxes came and they are 3x3. If you need a specific size box a DO NOT trust this seller. I use 4x4 regularly and went to ship using these boxes. Folded one up and it‚Äôs way too small. Also super super thin and flimsy
This jacket is okay. It is very thin but it does the job. If you are getting this be careful of the hat! The hat looks like a cone! It is not at all nice. For the price of this they could of done better.
I don‚Äôt like bad reviews but.... I Brought these home to my son and he was so excited until we put new batteries in and 2 do not work. (The control boxes) His comment was ‚Äòthat is annoying‚Äô!  They did get here in a timely manner
I like the feel and comfort of these face mask but the reason for my rating were they I have to do a extra tie to the ear the loops are too large they should have the adjustable ear loops
"I was under the impression that it was going to be assorted colors and sizes, but the package only contained like 10 BLUE, THUMB-SIZED thimbles. As far as them working, however, they do an excellent job of gripping the needle when pulling it through."
I got these because they seemed like they were the bigger options on Amazon but when they came they turned out to be really really small maybe 42 inch length but not even 12 inches across so it‚Äôs hard to fit three flakes in comfortably
This product is advertised as a replacement for the New Wave Water Filter however it does not fit. This water filter is not a replacement for that water filter or I may have a bad product?Anyway do NOT purchase this filter because it is non refundable.
Our family tradition! Every new walker needs these! They help keep them stable on there feet. They warn others to where they are(that‚Äôs a good thing) make an awesome keepsake. Awesome memories!‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞ü§©üòéüëÄüëç adorable! Shoe are pure quality! They out last the child.!
The material is exactly what I needed for the hot muggy summer days in the real America‚Äôs southern states.  The patches are perfect and the alligator with the tennis ball in his mouth is classic and snoopy looks disappointed as he walks away!
"These bands work great, they so their job. The designs are fine but rub off eventually. Not a big deal, since I just need something to protect my tank and for the price it's a lot better than going to a vape store."
I was really amazed how this self seal mailer was made.  Very sturdy. Your DVD Disc or Bluray Disc will work great and be safe to the address you send it to. Mail passage is rough treated sometimes. This mailer will stand up to rough treatment.
The cats like it...when it's not tipping over. The sisal is coming off. It is the newest one but it's made the cheapest and will have to be thrown away soon. Don't wait your money on this 19&#34; cat tree.
"I need to request people send these bees to my bird for Christmas so I can stock up on them! My bird loves this toy! Its durability is ""average,"" which is what it should be so my conure can destroy it nicely. It's great!"
The $10 and $20 hole sizes are too small and a $10 Indian or St. Gaudens won't fit in the holder sent.  The $2.50 and $5 fit fine but would look finny with only half the openings filled.  Will look for a different type set holder.
"The product came in a plastic bag, not in a box. It was scratched up and extremely difficult to turn. It looked used, not new. The compartment drawer was stuck then it wouldn‚Äôt open at all. Overall, I was bitterly disappointed."
Great tape for all you shipping needs. Strong and durable which is good whether your using it for personal use or business. Glue is very sticky and you can tell it is high quality and feel the difference. I'd recommend it for anyone looking for good strong tape!
"The description says these are silicone, they are not silicone, they are plastic.  Unfortunately since they are plastic, they will not stay in place and just slide down my head/hair causing the mask to unseal and be worse than not using the product"
Greatest purchase I‚Äôve made by far! Wear this with my freedom shorts and I can hear the cry of an American Bald Eagle soaring over head while Mad Dog Mattis pounds his chest with his fist. 1775/10 would buy again
Very comfortable AND I can still move in it! Great support too. I bought 4 other back belts and tested them all out at once. This one was the best for working in a warehouse like I do 5 days a week at 9 hours a day.
"Can't go wrong with Posca Pens.  I use them for painting on rocks.  They don't run when you seal the rocks .  Some last longer than others . . maybe they are older or something, but I will keep using them.  Thank you"
He loves it!  The minute we rolled it out Baby was on it.  Hopefully this will keep him off my mat when I‚Äôm doing yoga! ;-)Quality is good and highly recommend if your fur baby loves your yoga mat.
"These slippers are fluffy and soft.  However they run small.  I'm a size 7 and my heel was hanging off the edge a bit even without socks.  If you decide to get them, maybe get 1 size larger than your normal size."
My dughter loves this shirt. Super cute and nice material. Some of the seems are not sewn well and after just couple months decal on front is ruined. I am very goid at washing on gentle and inside out. Still came off shirt. That was disappointing. Wouldn't recommend this shirt.
This garment did not meet my expectations at all. The material is stiff and it doesn't feel comfortable. I like linen for its smooth and soft feel - absent here. The size is smaller than my size in other garments. Disappointed.
"The best part is the joy it will bring my grandson when he looks and say it is in s package üì¶ He will be thrilled, he is 6 and loves his Disney cars and his Godzilla collection! Thank you so much !"
I ordered these specifically because they said they were a PLUS size XXL. There is nothing plus sized about these pants. I wear a size 16/18 and I'm about 5'8. These didn't even make it up my thigh. It's more like a child's size small.
Used it to clean my kitchen tile floor and was amazed how good it looked !  No rinsing needed and the tile actually had a nice shine.  And the orange scent was delightful.  Well worth the price for something that really cleans.
excellent pen as always from rotring. The feel is excellent and the grip is fantastic. the pencil comes from smooth not like other pen where the pencil comes broken in pieces. It feels great in the hand and the writing is excellent. worth the money.
"My toddler has not rode this ride on very often and it broke after less than six months. We kept it in the garage and never got it wet. The horn and sounds still work, but it would not move at all even after charging it."
I bought to use for my scrapebook materials but found that when I pulled the drawer out the whole unit tipped unless I had something very heavy on it but that cause the top to bow so had to find something else.  Am using this now as scrapepaper storage.
"Bought for someone. They had to apply some heat to adjust the form a little, but with guidance from her therapist, she had help with the proper way to put it on, & is now much more comfortable to wear."
"You get a lot of pieces but be aware you have to pull apart the perforation so this will take some time- gently so not to rip them. We had 3 ppl, so about 15 min including positioning & hanging."
The advertising on this product is greatly misleading! So imagine my shock and surprise when I opened my packaging and saw that I got the 14 piece set instead of the 20 piece set with an extra clipper that was shown in the image!
"This is basically a big chamois for your doggie.  It works very well and you're basically paying for yardage, so we bought an XL even though the dog was only middle-sized at the time.  How can you go wrong with more drying towel?"
"This is comfortable, adjustable, and not bulky--I bet you could wear it under a shirt or sweater that's not too tight, and no one would notice. It really does help me sit up much straighter, and makes me more aware when I start to slouch."
Enjoying this product. Not bothering my stomach and I'm able to take it with very little food. Many supplements I've tried I've had to have a full meal in order to not have stomach problems. I've been feeling less tired since taking this supplement.
"One of my cats hates to be brushed. I found these gloves. They are not gigantic like so many others. They fit my hand close enough that they bend like a regular glove. Now my cat lets me pet/brush her, and I have less hair balls to clean up. :)"
Nice lightweight long sleeved shirt. This has easily become one of my favorite everyday tops. Don‚Äôt expect it to be warm. I wear a tank underneath and it‚Äôs perfect for me. Roomy around the waist area which is great. Very cute!
I love this dress and according to the reviews it fit as expected.  I wear a size 12 - 14 and it fit just right.  It is still loose and flowy and a bit snug around the arms.  Over all I really like this dress.
We made the best holiday presents for family and friends with these! The paint does not dry out and our baby really enjoyed playing with them. The colours are vibrant and painting always makes for the perfect afternoon activity. Clean-up is also surprisingly easy.
These were a little too large inside for my door stops so I ended up gluing them on with Gorilla Glue. My puppy was removing them and chewing up the originals. Now she can't get these off - Thanks to Gorilla Glue
Maybe these or for a kid and I didn‚Äôt realize it. This barely got around my thigh so I didn‚Äôt wear it and didn‚Äôt even bother returning it. If you have normal sized thighs this won‚Äôt work. If you‚Äôre skinnier than the average person maybe they will.
"the box came very neatly and around the date it was expected to arrive. the figure is in perfect, brand new shape, doesn't look like there's any damage. the price is very good as well, so i'm glad it held up to my expectations! &#60;3"
"Loved the design, plates were perfect and super cute but the table cloth was defective, printed blurry which made our party table look cheap, I was disappointed. It was great value for all the pieces, hope quality would have been better."
"Very cute dress, worked perfectly for my 1920s Pike Trickfoot cosplay. It fit me pretty well (was a little tight in the chest, but my chest is large and I‚Äôm used to it). There also wasn‚Äôt a lot of bead fall out whenever I wore it."
Lovely dress. Feels like pjs but looks so nice. Swishes and flows. I got an XL (I‚Äôm typically an L or XL) and this fits well. Got lots of compliments wearing out running errands! Would be equally lovely at a summer wedding or special event. Hopefully it holds up well.
"These were supposed to be XXL oversized sunglasses and they're not even close. As soon as I took them out of the package I could tell they were too small and would not fit properly. If you require extra large sunglasses like I do, don't waste your time on these."
"I like how they fit, the features, cool style. Bought a pair that were too small and they sent me a new pair before I even got them back my return. I can use them for my mountain bike or even my motorcycles."
Ok but needs a rubber pad or something for some friction. So the arm stays in the position you place it in. Mine tends to want to twist which ever way the arm's tubing wants to go. Sticks very well to tile though.
I was sending out a lot of stuff for the holidays and felt so much better knowing my purchase was good for the environment and a tree would be planted! The material was very strong and durable and the design is great! Will definitely buy more!! Great price too
This device provided me space for two years of financial document storage. Great concept and the color provides a good look. The only thing that disappointed me is the fact once you fill it with papers it‚Äôs not easy to transport it from place to place.
Bought it as an xmas gift for my son. He loves it! Took 1 star off as it only came with the 3 discs shown in the pic all of them were lost within minutes. Pick up a big refill pack along with this thing.
"Product is very cheaply made, I thought it was the original, it isn‚Äôt. Packaging was shoddy, falling apart. I was afraid to switch the head‚Äôs because of how flimsy the product was. 1 star because I couldn‚Äôt give it none!"
"We ordered these for my son‚Äôs sixth birthday giveaway for his classroom. I think they are unisex enough that they will be perfect as a giveaway. Now that you can‚Äôt bring treats anymore, it is sometimes hard to figure out what to bring for a kids birthday :-)"
"Got this for my dog. I love it, but my wife got mad since it's for a female dog, and she looks like a &#34;male dog&#34; now.She just looks tacticool to me. But I do like this a lot. Fits her well, and has proven very durable so far."
thought this prouduct was so cute! The pieces are a nice size for little hands! Bigger than I expected! I gave this to my friends little boy for his 2nd birthday (camp fire themed) and she sent me a pic of him playing with it!
Fantastic tray. Sturdy. Installation is just pushing it over the walker's handles. Rubber holds ir securely in place. Recessed cup holder catches spills. Non slip surface. Great color and price. I can't say enough good things about this. Delivery was fast. Love it!
The plastic pieces that regulate the lenght of the dolly brokeat the first time I used it. I had to wrap silvertape very tightly around itso it was usable again. This fix makes it impossible to close/collapse this product.The wheels and the metal frames are very strong though.
"I wanted to love these because they look great on, however the material caused a lot of irritation and chafing.I would not recommend these as there are others that have better compression and are softer than I have purchased on Amazon for less."
So beautiful! Totally classy and elegant!! Writes very smoothly. Not too Heavy. Nice balance. Cap stays on the back nicely. 2 coworkers liked it so much they are ordering it as well! For the price? A no brainer! I highly recommend.
"I have tried wearing this several times now and every slight movement sets it off. I am 5'5"" and weigh 136 lbs. I really think this is more for children than adults.  I am going to try and send it back"
"Ordered a size up so they wouldn‚Äôt be too sheer. Now they won‚Äôt stay up. If I had gotten my usual size, you would definitely be able to see right through them. Even with next size up, you can still see my underwear from behind."
Well if you want to brighten a package for shipping this is the ticket. Otherwise very thin and hardly durable. I had to use clear packing tape first to make sure the box stayed closed then added this over the top. It‚Äôs a cheerful addition but not what I expected
The plastic is slippery and it‚Äôs a simple fix but I don‚Äôt like mending my purchases. manufacturers should have coughs this issue. I put a rug on top and I‚Äôm thinking of using bathtub tape on it so my pup can walk with out kissing her footing
"I was worried about buying clothing online but it has been the best simple cute dress I have ever purchased, it was a little too big but I returned for a smaller size and it was PERFECT! It is very breathable material and the pockets are a PLUS!"
"The dress I received is not the dress I ordered. The top is lace, the bottom is plain chiffon, there are no cutouts or flower details. It is a completely different dress and it looks like it has been used."
"But, I have gone through 2 of these already. The bottom part of the barrel, no matter how tight you screw down, ends up getting lost. If there was a more durable way of the 2 pieces staying together, I would buy another set."
"This corset was amazing, super easy to put on and wear, it was comfortable and I got a tons of compliments.. I normally wear a large so I went a size bigger and got an extra large. It fit perfect!! Looking for more colors now.."
it wasn't worth it at all yeah its cute it's very small but the worst of it was didn't seem to give the amount of bubbles it advertised i seen something same size for 6.99 worked the same so i definitely wouldn't buy it again
"This gadget does the job well.  I love that you don't have to refill it, just recharge it,  and not fool with lighter fluid. However, I loved the torch I bought earlier much better but I couldn't refill it and neither could my boyfriend."
these came in their own separate cloth bags and the are much longer and wider than others. with some others my feet did not fit on the blocks. I am US women's size 10 and I have room to spare
"My very young son recently developed a fascination with monster trucks and necklaces, and this was the best of both worlds. The necklace is high quality and the perfect size for a toddler. It has held up well thus far, and I highly recommend this product!"
"This rake is so easy to use, even with my arthritus. It picks up our Husky's hair with ease and makes the carpet look like it was just vaccumed.We have a high priced Kirby w/pet roller. It won't even touch it.Buy this product, you won't regreet it."
"I bought this solely because I needed a pair of short black legs for my Blues Brothers minifigs. He, indeed, has the required short black legs.That said, it's a high quality figure, in particular in how the hair works with the quiver."
Very fun to put together. Like other space rails that I've bought it's tricky to position the rails in order to prevent the ball from falling off. Instructions aren't clear on how long to cut the pieces of tube and doing this is really difficult to measure.
I bought the Ty Beanie Baby Slowpoke the sloth because my college age niece loves sloths. This was purchased as a gift.She said it was a great Beanie Baby- well made and her dog even got a hold of it and didnt hurt it.I recommend this product.
"Good size and like the style, Wore holes in them within a month of normal wear and tossed them.  I walk a ton at work though,  regular light office duty and you might get more life out of them."
"Love the colors.  Love the fit.  So far I have bought several RBX tops and capris for the gym, and they all fit the same, feel great and are nice quality.  I have no reason to try another brand."
"This is genuine, excellent product and works as expected.I bought it for my brother.He likes taking this supplement. It keeps good immunization all the time, helped good daily life andstay energized and focused. It works ~I'll be buying again for sure!"
"I take D3 and K2 every day.  I hate taking pills.  So, having both vitamins combined into 1 pill is such a bonus for me.Pills are small enough for me to swallow with ease.Nice size bottle that will last me for awhile."
"Excellent value for the money! So difficult to find furniture for traditional doll houses and these were perfect! My granddaughters, age 7 and 9, absolutely love them! They particularly loved the bathtub and shower set! Modern yet classy shower and nothing like the plain wooden sets for younger girls' dollhouses."
I needed comfortable waterproof boots for yard work.  These were like a broken in pair of shoes from the beginning.  My feet stayed dry through the wet grass.  They appear to be well-made and should be durable.
The kit includes some sheets of colored paper and directions to make planes. However the directions don't make any sense for some of the airplanes. Looks like no one tested the directions before they started selling this. So I paid $9 just for colored paper. Very disappointed.
"My pug really likes this food.  She is totally sold on the fact that there is a pug on the packaging.  I don't really know what pug food is because I know she would like it to be bananas, cake, yogurt, watermelon and apples."
"These are so very thin. They are not supportive at all. I never stack my insoles but that's the quality of these, so thin. These will not work for flat feet. 2 people in my house have low arches and both of us share the same opinion."
"These clippers were the perfect size and sharp enough, but the guard kept flopping all over the place and I had to use two hands to open and close them; they were so stiff. These were more hassle than they are worth."
"I chose this for my 2 and 5 year old over one of the smaller versions with an interactive pen.  I gave this to them and a 3D atlas app.  They love it, and go to it often because it is lit up."
I gave these to my husband as a small thank you gift. He loves it!! He likes to go out with the guys and smoke a couple cigars while golfing or relaxing and drinking. This case is so nice and has a great look to it. Very nice!
"These pads with excellent leak proof, I tried these pads for few days, compared with other brand, they leave no water on the floor at all. So far so good. I will continue to using this brand in the future."
"Nice, solid construction.  If you're looking for something to carry in your pocket you might prefer one of the aluminum cases because this is a little heavy but if you're looking for something to stand up to some mild rough treatment (which I was) this is an excellent option."
"No problem at all with these socks. They‚Äôre comfortable, look okay and the pairs come in two plain shades of black and gray, which is not a complaint whatsoever. The material isn‚Äôt too thick nor too sheer. Any questions? I‚Äôm happy to answer them!"
"Button flickers on mine.. so sometimes its a nice solid beam of light.. sometimes its seizure inducing.  Would not buy again.Also, these ship from china which Amazon has no mention of on the product page.. so be prepared for a very very long month of waiting for delivery."
"Arrived quickly! I set it right up, it was simple to assemble. My 2 cats went right for it. It's helped a lot with the cats not digging on our furniture! It's a win win! They love it. I also put a little cat nip on it! Lol"
Good use for my cat. My cats go in and out of our room as they pleased. This is a life saver. Way better solution than my husband thrown something on the floor so I can step on it and curse.
"I got these for my granddaughter, but I have to admit I kept the little Beluga for myself! He lives on my dashboard now. They're pretty awesome, not like the cheap plastic animals that you usually see; I would call these collectable."
"I purchased this product because it said it was TEAR RESISTANT.  By any stretchof the imagination IT IS NOT!  Even though I used two liners, they both tore easily the first day.  I only have one cat.  I'd like a refund because it wasn't cheap."
"These aren‚Äôt quite as colorful as they look in the photos here, but they are perfect otherwise. I thought the rubber pieces for a straw cover but they‚Äôre actually so you lips aren‚Äôt frozen while drinking out of the stainless straw."
"Great product, the dogs love it.  Quality dog chews like this are very expensive though.  It's hard to spend so much on chews that will be gone in no time.  I've asked the question if they're made in the USA - but didn't receive an answer."
These guards are amazing. The plastic really glides and makes for smooth strokes. The metal inserts really ensure they will hold up after heavy use. Anyone who is frequently doing fades would really benefit from the .5 and 1.5 guards.
"I got this in a size small, purple color. It is a trapeze style. Its flares out bigger at the bottom. I personally don't like that style. I always wear a small and this was too big on me. The color was so pretty."
Always curious as to the use of this type of paper toweling.  I love this product and will purchase again.  Super on the budget as no need to over use as with throw-away paper towels. Fast delivery. A++ experience. Thanks!
"My daughter absolutely loves these! A couple of them broke off their stand the first day, and a couple couldn‚Äôt stand on their own. BUT for the price I think they are good. My daughter doesn‚Äôt care and she still plays with them."
"The rubber is very weak, the rubber is torn after a short use.  The boy just took off the mask and it tore.  And this is not the first to be torn. For children who use it it should be stronger"
"My kids love the glow in the dark pieces. I got this on a daily deal, so the price was great. We love ZOOBS. They do break from time to time, so my kids were happy to get a new set to add to their collection."
"Suction power is alright and it‚Äôs also easy to clean. The built-in light is a bonus, because now, I don‚Äôt have multiple cords plugged into the wall! I believe this filter would be best for fishes that won‚Äôt produce a lot of waste."
"Sent these to give my 75 year old mother a chuckle as she prepares to leave for Mexico on a plane.  We both got a good laugh out of the tissues, and she is studying the 'how to land an airplane' one just in case!! ;)"
"Love it, wanted to see how it would fit on my desk, knowing if I liked it and it fit I would turn around right away and order same one.  I do not want the other styles of this brand, I want this one.PLEASE GET THIS BACK IN STOCK."
This is a good toy for kittens. I will save it for when I have one again. The mouse moves very fast. There is no anticipation to it which adult cats seem to like. I wish it had a speed setting on it.
It didn't fit like it should and it doesn't come with a pad so I had to put paper towels in it. And once the dog peed it soaked through the paper towels and then the diaper got wet and so did anything he sat on.
"It sounded too good to be true but I decided to give it a try. Problem #1, it comes in a plastic bottle and that is a huge NO-NO for probiotics. That tells me they don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing so it‚Äôs going back"
"This is my 3rd or 4th time reordering. They are the perfect size. They fix my product perfectly with no extra space and no stuffing needed, cuts down on the weight. I also love the white clean color. Wish they were a little less expensive, though."
"WOW! A friend recommended that I try MCT Lean vegan protein and now I'm hooked!!! I can't believe it's vegan! It's delicious and filling - I mostly use for smoothies in the morning or post work out! Great taste, great product, great price! Thanks! A+++"
So much fun!  I bought these thinking they were larger - but I'm glad they weren't!  Not only are they great as markers for Magic the Gathering but I found they work great as tokens for HeroClix and HaloClix!
"Love this little door stopper. I use it in my RV to hold the bathroom door open when we aren't completely level.  It is stylish and small, but best of all the weight it perfect to hold the door open.  I highly recommend this door stopper."
"They are easy to attach, you just slide one on each ear piece on the frame,adjust it to your liking. They keep your glasses where you like them to stayand you get 10 pair. What more can you ask for. They come in colors too, I got theBlack ones."
"great quality. Does have that slight &#34;dirty&#34; beet taste but the benefits are worth it. Mixed in a smoothie it's no problem and takes away the afternoon snack cravings. All round, just a great anti-oxidant high in beneficial vitamins and minerals."
I bought this to clean a new Kohler farmhouse sink after a blogger recommended it. It is extremely difficult to remove any stains with it without extreme scrubbing. Even with that the dark grey pot scuffs still do not come off.
"I purchased these to use as holders for programs at a service I am helping to create on Recreating Unity.  The only thing that is disappointing, but not a surprise, is though the are to represent the USA in the service, they are made in China."
The description indicated that it came with a spare light bulb.  Not sure if I was sent the wrong item or if the description is wrong.  What I received was 3 lanterns with wire frames.  No light kits and no bulbs.
Hat is cute and perfect size for kids but was disappointed that the picture was cheaply stuck on as if it was a thin sticker and it definitely most likely will crack or peel off if it gets tossed in the wash.
I purchased this for my wedding. It is so beautiful in person and was absolutely what I was looking for.  The price is an exceptional value as well.  Thanks for offering my perfect wedding necklace at an affordable price.
This is just a very heavy piece of glass that is not worth the price. It is not ‚Äúmagnetic‚Äù. You need very heavy magnets to get it to stick - not as advertised. The hardware it comes with do not fit. Don‚Äôt buy this and save your money.
"The shirt is alright. I love the shape/cut of it, but don't much like the material. It fits as expected and looks just like the picture except the blue is darker than pictured. With the material, black trim, and darker blue, it looks like a shirt more for the fall."
Could just be me but seems the Lex Luthor figurine is slightly out of scale (too tall) in comparision to the rest of the line. I can understand the power suit giving the impression but even his head is larger than any of the other male figurines.
"Would give this 5 stars if the very fragile chain hadn't broken on the first day.  I replaced it with a sturdier chain and have enjoyed wearing it often.  The pendant itself is lovely, but recommend that you buy a sterling chain as well when ordering."
The valve is not long enough to get maximum inflation and close without losing air.  Design is such that it collapses when dog is on float.  Very unsatisfied and would not buy again.  As a note my lab is only 30#
"This is cute and it is pink. I am the quality appears to be just OK. The stapler is smaller than a typical stapler but it  works fine .. it comes with staples and pushpins and paper, clips and thumbtack pens. Great price for all that you get."
My son has asthma I bought this for his room. I don't have an air quality tester but as far as I know it seems to help. I do know the room smells better.I'm going to buy a larger one for the living room since Spring is coming.
I have a 10 lb Shih Tzu & he just loves this! I put the noodles in this Guacamole Hide & Seek Puzzle Plush Squeaky Dog Toy & it really gives him a good challenge & it's great on its own too.
"Good price, exactly as described, they aren‚Äôt as easy to build as legos, my 6 year old son can follow most junior LEGO set instructions and build on his own, however I build these sets as the instructions aren‚Äôt easy for a little one."
"Springrain Men‚Äôs Athletic Sherpa is just right for my needs.  Mid-weight for cooler, breezy weather.  Fits as expected.  Zip pockets add security for those items to be carried. Only negative is that zipper is on women‚Äôs side, not men‚Äôs side."
There was only 24 envelopes in one of the packages. Most places where I have ordered envelopes there is an extra one in each pack. These are for a wedding. I needed 100 not 99. I paid for 100 envelopes!
This elbow pad for Bursitis would be ok if it were not so big for a female.  The method of fastening is way too bulky for me to wear to work.  Returned it as I could not use it.  I was disappointed.
"What is ""sheerness""?  No idea.But this is a good mouse pad.My one suggestion for improvement is to use black thread for the edges.  I had to use a black marker to color the white threads on the black mousepad to avoid distraction."
"Suppose to be magnetic, comes rolled up small so that it is permanently formed to that shape, doesn‚Äôt unroll and stick to magnetic objects. Laminated is bubbled, Markers are not magnetic. Do yourself a favor and spend a couple more dollars for something of higher quality."
"Very nice, cozy and love the indoor outdoor sole.  I bought for a size bigger than needed for a little growing room and the slipper fits as I expected, just a little too big but not big enough that the slippers don't fit."
The description of the item states: Model: 11.8 x 19.8 Inches. See pictures for inaccuracy. Waste of time to have to drop the item at UPS and find a new one to purchase. Also have to wait over 2 weeks to get my money back.
"This is such a cute toy but the sounds are very strange. I assumed since it's a pirate ship the sounds would have the same theme. It has odd dance music and car sounds rather than ocean/ship/pirate songs. My grandson likes it but even said ""it sounds like a car""."
"These are well made, waterproof, and thick enough not to worry about tearing. The price is reasonable and the sizes are designed well. It's difficult to do a review for something like this as they are really just dish washing gloves, but these are excellent for what they are.5 stars"
"We needed a sword for our Monty Python and the Holy Grail costumes, and this was perfect.  Touched it up with a little gold paint, since it comes silver and Excalibur should be gold.  Only issue was that one handle was slightly warped, but not too noticeable."
"this was a complete waste of time and money.  it's WAY to big and the back says ""department of COLLECTIONS"" they failed to mention that in the description nor did they add a photo of the back. needless to say it's going back"
"My son loves these.  I wish they weren't so pricey, but these are what he asks for as gifts.  They aren't your typical toys to play with; more of a collectible item.  These are smaller toys and not squishy in case you are not familiar with them."
"Got the 8-10 for my about-to-be-8-yr-old daughter. Definitely has some room to grow, but that was the idea. It's a little loose on top. Note that the turquoise color is a dark turquoise and not a lighter aqua as shown."
I have a hard time keeping by boobs from popping out the top. I ordered a size bigger because I had originally ordered the correct sized and it was small. Needed to by double sided skin tape to keep from falling out.
Works.  I use a paper towel to apply on my dog's nose - I do so to keep the product clean from bacteria.  I've been applying it 2 x day for 2 weeks and his nose looks so much better.  I will continue to purchase this product.
if you have short hair like me this still works (ive heard from some people that it wouldnt work with short hair idk) and it gives a nice texture plus im able to go without washing my hair for longer when i use it
"I charged the trimmer when I first received it . I went to use it a second time and it was dead . Charged it again and after sitting for 2 weeks , I went to use it & again the battery was dead . I‚Äôm returning the item ."
"I also think they‚Äôre pretty cool, especially with the lights on. My six year old had a blast playing with them when they arrived last night, and it was fine inside. I told him today we‚Äôd take them out to try, worth it!!"
This was a perfect fit for the Goolsky 2204 surpass brushless motor I installed in my Axial SCX24. It pairs perfectly with the hot racing MOD .5 spur gear. The output shaft of the motor is a perfect fit for this pinion gear.
This beats paper cuts when you try and open the letter with your fingers!!!!I don't know why but the letter operners that I buy for my home seem to get lost when other people see how easy it is to open the letters
Love them however they fit a bit tight so you may want to consider ordering a size up! I‚Äôm  typically a size 4/6 I‚Äôm a bit hippy and the small fit extremely tight. These pants are nice so I will definitely purchase a med.
It fits wonderfully in my scrub top and pants pocket. It looks clean and the quick reference guides are nice as well. I just feel like for the cost it should come with the band for holding papers and a pen clip. After all this is a $30+ clipboard
"I am like this lava pumic stone. It is giving my feet such a relief when I‚Äôm robbing it. Comfortably, the robbing and massaging has been healing for my feet because I‚Äôm a runner. The robbing kills unnecessary extra skins for me. I'd buy it again for my families"
Great toy for a small dog. Easy to carry. Lots to chew on. Plenty for the owner to grab and play tug with. Not too heavy but heavy enough to throw. Seems sturdy - or at least as sturdy as dog toys are. Quality product this dog recommends.
You're suppose to be able to pull the strings and on of them release the trap door. But it doesn't work very well and you can only stuff it with really small items otherwise they won't fit through the trap door.
"I‚Äôve had it for three weeks.Good news: my Bichon/Poodle mix loves it, even without adding toothpaste or anything flavored.Bad news: it doesn‚Äôt hold up to his love and he‚Äôs chewed off the nubs and already tore through the material.I wouldn‚Äôt consider him the toughest/roughest chewer, either üòï"
"This is a great piece of equipment to have, but if you buy this make sure you are an advanced user, or that you are willing to learn how to use it. I really like the flexibility of this receiver."
[[VIDEOID:5a5d95f05908d21d64548a9d202904c4]] Great aquarium! I upgraded from a 29 Biocube. Drilled the back with diamond hole saw for spillover drain into 20 gal refugium and return inlet with power jets. Used Orbit LED light instead of stock. Beautiful reef tank! Glass cleans easily with magnet scrubber.
"Perfect for any average sized cat. My large 17 lb DSH cat fits snugly when it's zipped up (and loves it) but has plenty of room when the mesh part is opened. Really good quality materials, zipper works perfectly, no complaints at all."
I have been using them since the earlly '80's!! I use to get them at Caswell Massey in NYC! Now they are hard to find! They get softer as you use them so they last a long time!! Much better than toothpicks or floss!!
"My printer gets jammed when I try printing with a stack of papers, so I need to feed in one sheet at a time, finessing it to go in.  So this is pretty bad for print jobs requiring several pages."
I really hoped it was a real solution. I tried using it at 3 times the dosage and some fish did have some improvement but not effective enough for tangs. bought two bottles and a third locally. What a wait of money.
Finally a pet barrier that works! I tried the Weathertech brand and it was terrible. It never stayed in place. The Sherpa is super easy to install and the sliders that extend the width are lockable so your dogs can‚Äôt move them. I installed mine in a 2021 Chevy Suburban.
This version does not stick to the face like the original Ortopads. Within a few minutes of application the area at the bridge of the nose would become unstuck. We tried several patches but they just wouldn‚Äôt stay on. Will be ordering more of the originals.
"I was a little unsure about ordering slippers online. Because I always have issues with size, but they fit perfect! My shoe is a 9, I believe I ordered a 7-8. Washed them once already, and they didn't come out damaged in any way."
Needed leg covers fast and these worked ok but ripped the second they went on.All 4 legs split at the seems.Not very well made. Luckily only needed for 1 week before show but these will not last longer than that.
My cats could care less about this thing. It is also smaller than it appeared. Returning costs $1 less than the toy itself so it stays to gather dust. Save your $8. I highly doubt that the wonderful reviews are actually valid reviews.
"My dog loves this toy, maybe I should say obsessed. I wasn't sure he would get the hang of it, but boy did he. He goes nuts when he sees me load it and wind the timer for him to play."
"Who doesn't like to make a great first impression? Even if your business cards aren't that great, this holder will make that first impression better. Durable and very strong magnets ‚Äì will keep it securely closed even if you use the wrong side!"
I bought the denim colored skirt. The fabric is thin so great for summer. There is no stretch to the fabric.  I was surprised how much I liked this skirt. It fits true to size. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 132lbs and the medium fits perfect.
"Very nice reading glasses but after 2 months the arm fell off. Then a week later the glass came out of another pair, do not buy. I called them and they said they wound send me replacements. After 2 months I am still have not received them."
I bought this for a co-worker who decided to leave and go down a different path and wanted something for her new job where she could remember me by. This was super cute and quality made and my co-worker loved it!
"So much cheaper than if bought in office supply store. Toner should be this price all the time. Cartridges are authentic and came in sealed and original HP packaging, including HP seals, so it is obvious they are not knock-offs. Printing has been great."
"This is definitely not a small.  Even though the tag in the vest states small, it is the exact same size as a medium that I was trying to replace. Now I have two vests that are too big."
"I found that the bottle isn't large enough to hold 8oz of liquid plus my one scoop of protein powder and half scoop of dextrose powder. I only need to measure out 8 ounces of liquid but I need a bigger bottle, this one is useless for me."
"I‚Äôve tried a lot of different journals, and this is the only one I‚Äôve re-bought. The quality is excellent and sturdy, and the paper is the perfect thickness.  There is little to no bleed-through or feathering, even with my fountain pens."
"I bought it smaller because my daughter is small. But it is still too big. Maybe it will fit her in another 2 years.The fabric is pretty thin and unlined, but not see thru.For the price it was a good purchase."
I have it covered in my back seat because I have a toddler and when he snacks and spills all I have to do is vacuum it up. Also good to know really good for potty training children because it does spill out and now it's not on my seat.
