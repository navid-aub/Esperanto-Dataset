"I bought this tape to adhere carpet but now I use it for a lot. Like a sign on a door, putting material around a lampshade or inside material on a flag pole to keep it from sliding down. Think of it as large duct tape double-sided greatness."
Obviously this is a child's toy however I bought this because my adult children were coming back home for Christmas and it made a good stocking stuffer because what's better than a bunch of 20 year olds running around shooting each other with Nerf guns
This came really really late but was as described. We gave it as a gift. It’s kind of hard to get the image to show up because you have to get the light in the right angle but it is cool.
Really cute. I am 5&#34;5 about 130lbs. I bought a medium. Based on my jean sizes of 4 to 6. These defiantly were good quality but are a little big in the waist an got losser the longer I worn them.
"Arrived promptly and undamaged. The colored pens and stencils are a nice bonus. I like the pen holder and ribbon bookmarks, too. Good quality cover. The paper is decent, but I would like it if it was a bit thicker, especially when using felt-tip pens."
Comfortable and durable....if it stays on.The white one just falls off during the day on its own merit. The blue one seems to stay on at least. 50/50 chance this watch band set will be successful!Also careful when you wear sweaters. This does attach via velcro.
"The combination set is prettier than the picture. It appears sturdy, but not to heavy. The description is accurate, but again it s a lovely set. The color of purple was dark purple, but vivid color. Glad I purchased for a gift!I will order one for myself also!"
"I used this product and it didn't really work well for me. It didn't ""wash"" my back as good as i was hoping it would. The rubber just bounced around on my skin because it would not lather the soap."
I usually wear a size 14 so after reading the size chart I decided to order a 2X and it fits perfect material is super soft. I really really on product reviews when purchasing clothes so I wanted to write my own hope it helps
This mat truly holds the litter and looks pretty doing it. I ended up buying 4 of them in three different colors. Great colors and they are super quality. Just because its a litter mat doesn't mean you don't want it to look nice!
"Great for teachers. Nice quality dice overall, but I suspect that the lettering will begin to rub off in the next few months. Note; this is not a game itself, it is just the dice, you will need to develop your own uses for them."
"Works better to wear over socks as they seemed to slide forward throughout the day. Disliked the included arch supports, as they slide easily. The adhesive is a good idea, but only if you're going to wear 1 pair of shoes all of the time."
"[[VIDEOID:c3012424dad6a0ae6b56539cdfbc052a]] THERE IS NO BOARD, IF YOU BUY THIS YOU'LL BE BOARD, THIS IS JUST THE PIECES, THERE IS NO BOARD, YOU WILL JUMP OFF THE BOARD, BUYER BEWARE. Pieces are not bad tho but scam anyway but factory marks"
"So far they seem to do the trick. My daughters gaite is offand she has flat feet (non verbal, autistic) Her doc suggested inserts and i bought these. She's doing so well she even attempts to run now. I'll probably need to buy a few more."
"I like the fact this probiotic gives me a nice boost of energy, and at the same time helping my digestion system stay on track. My body notices if I miss a day, so I try not to! Best probiotic I've found to date. Would highly recommend!!"
"Great colors to brighten up exercise clothes or jeans and a T-shirt.  Just a hint of the bright color showing around my tennis shoes!  And I just wear them around the house to keep toes warm watching television, et. al.  Great buy!"
"LOVE LOVE LOVE this fantastic multi-use hook!!! Works great on everything from my gym bag to wet towels to grocery bags full of food, I'm able to store lots of equipment on this fabulous item everyone should have one or two!!! Great gift idea as well!!!!"
I originally ordered my 4 year old son a size 5/6 but it ended up being a little tight so I reordered for a 7/8 and it fit perfect with a little bit more room to grow! Love the material and my son loves it! Thanks!
"It's a great figurine! It's bigger than what I was expecting and the detail on it is amazing! It's great for One Piece fans. I am not particularly a big fan of Big Mom, but this one is worth the money."
"surprised to learn how difficult it is to find lined paper with landscape orientation.  It would be great for this to have a top sheet which is greater thickness and for it to be bound, to keep this tablet clean and together."
"Over sized and frame feels like it could break at any moment. The ""transition"" feature barely works.  Left them on the hood of my car in direct sunlight and they got dim...not dark.  They also smudge and scratch very easily."
"My cat knocks over the water often and moves his bowl. I wish it was heavier or had suction cups. If I walk past it too fast and bump it with my shoe, it slides way across the floor. Very cheap light weight material"
Better than expected.  Has hidden zipper in the scarf section.  DO NOT PUT THIS IN THE DRYER.  Must air dry.  If you do expect to lose some of the &#34;fluff&#34;  My daughter absolutely loves it.
"The cleaner is good, the problem is the attractive bottle …. It just doesn’t work well. Specifically the bottle’s plastic trigger top - it doesn’t spray out well. It doesn’t work on spray or stream, product just leaks out of the plastic top."
"Glasses for you kids are young to come by, but these looked good on my son. Unfortunately, the lenses constantly pop out and I'm afraid one day they will get lost. The Strap also falls down the back of my sons head pushing into the top of his little years."
Purchased this item after my granddaughters Occupational Therapist had a similar one she was so taken and intrigued by this product I purchased the same day after her therapy was complete. But the seller I purchased it I will never do it again. Product was defective.
These are very nice quality bookmarks.  I included them in a “ friendly letter” to a group of 5th graders during remote learning.  The students really liked them and were happy to receive them.  Nice price for educators on a budget!
Best pill organizer I have ever used. Has morning and night symbols which are easy to visualize. I also like that the boxes stay open while you fill them!! Large enough to see meds when you open the box. Thanks
"Don't buy this ，A few pieces were already broken when it arrived! I messaged the business but no one responded. I assembled the remaining few boards, but the screws didn't easily get into the pieces. Totally unusable! Don't waste your money!"
These worked great.  Adhered well to the badge and the magnet is strong enough to hold even on a sweater.  Would definitely purchase again.  Purchased 10 but I may need to buy more because my friends all want them now and I have been sharing with them.
"Im a collector and i think he is cute. The shading in his body is nice but the shading in his mane and tail is very flat. If this is for a kid, i am sure they would not care though."
My cat loves this chaise. Its his favorite sleeping area. Not only is it stylish but im super happy he actually uses it. I am pleased with this purchase and I like the storage on the bottom so I can put all his toys in there.
"These are nice pens, write well, they look great and feel good. The only reason, not a 5 is one of the pens will not work, there is basically not a pen head in the pen. Still a nice set."
"These are the best socks I've ever owned. I've literally thrown out all of my other socks, beyond formal/dress socks, and bought several packs of these. These aren't padded, but they're comfortable, do not fray, and look appropriate for any non-formal situation."
This puzzle was kind of a b*tch to put together. I admit I used scotch tape to keep the pieces together. It’s a pretty puzzle but I would never buy another like it - The pieces don’t click quite  infuriating
Only two of the five blocks make a noise which has a musical quality. And yet two more have identical sounds despite being different shapes and sizes. If this toy is educational because of shapes/sizes and because of musical quality then I feel cheated.
I have been using this product for over 10 years and absolutely love it. I mix it with Coconut or Vitamin E oil to use on my body. Usually get it at a beauty supply store but its not always available. Glad I finally found it on Amazon.
Bad product.  It pinches and twists my dogs nails weird after just two uses.  Also it became dull after the second use. Not worth it unless your dog has tiny nails. I have a dachshund and it doesn't work anymore
"I bought this watch as an everyday / business casual accessory, it has exceeded my expectations; my only drawback with this item is that the buttons became discolored.  But in fairness this may be due to body chemistry and not product quality."
The arm on the figure I received was not able to sit flush with the rest of the body. It sat higher on the body than the other arm. Other than that this is a great addition to a Spider-Man action figure collection
"I bought this product on a whim and I am very pleased with it, it will be my go-to catnip from now on my cats seem to enjoy it more than they've enjoyed any other can if I've ever purchased for them. I am now a lifelong meowjuana fan"
"this collar only works some of the time when he barks.....wrote with questions about returning, never got a response.  Batteries run out very fast and he has figured that the collar does not always work, so he still barks."
"I absolutely love this cardigan! It’s nice and thick and comfortable, doesn’t itch or scratch. It’s the perfect length if you like longer cardigans. Will definitely keep you warm in a cold environment, and it’s also light weight. So happy I got it!"
"This was my first wood puzzle. Incredible durability. And the poster with the box helped Sooo much. Otherwise, we’d still be putting it together. But with it being slightly larger than the puzzle, it was much easier to find the location of each piece. Section by section, letter by letter."
"Just got this in. Hooked it up to my wired network and Mac, PC and Linux were all immediately able to see/print to it. The print jobs I got out of it... stunning. The colors are rich and vibrant; the print speed is quite good; I just love this printer."
"As one of my New Years goals I decided I wanted to lose a few pounds, 15 to be precise. I got this to control myself and be consistent with what I was eating. It's been working great, there is no chance of missing my goal and overeating."
"I was looking to move up to a higher MERV air filter, but was concerned with the increased resistance the 1&#34; filters add as MERV goes up. I think this is the solution to my problem...higher MERV and it shouldn't increase the resistance much."
"I've been using this product for years, but this time I was sent two with different labels and color creams?? Not sure if one is fake?? It smells and feels the same so I guess I'll still use it! Just wondering if that's okay though?"
"As other reviews have stated, the inserts reduce the suction of the pump. If you have an adjustable pump you can set the suction higher to compensate. The fit is much improved for larger nipples and makes pumping much more comfortable."
"These are gorgeous and yes a little pricey but worth every penny. I recently did a remodel in my home and put these throughout, and they look so nice they match the bronze/brass hinges and the hardware on the doors."
"Very cute and well made. Nice vibrant color. My dogs like to chew on this. They aren't heavy chewers though, that's what their treats are for. It was given to them as a holiday gift and so far, about a month later, it's still in splendid shape."
My 90 pound golden loves this pool she is always jumping in and out of it with her toys. Very easy to fill have used it a few times and has not torn with her nails. It’s a little difficult to drain because the drainer is on the bottom.
"These bulbs put out a great amount of heat, and this is a good deal considering how many you’re getting, but every two months or so the bulb randomly goes out and I wake up to a sad, cold beardie."
I bought this for my 2 year old granddaughter and she played and played with it with me.  I made the dinosaurs have voices and we played hide and seek with them in their houses and stacked them challenging her to not allow them to topple over
"Cute, great quality bathing ducks. They come in 4 bright colors - pink, green, yellow, blue. They all have a little hole on their beak which I plan to glue in so the duckies don't get moldy inside when they get wet."
I bought this for NYE but didn't end up wearing it due to the fabric. The fabric reminds me of a Halloween costume- stretchy and not put together well. Looks like I'll be a witch this year for Halloween :)
"It is really a cat massager.  well, the dogs like it too.  But it also works as a comb, it collects the fur and it is easy to remove.  What is not to love.  Get it, your cats will thank you."
Cute stuffy but the lights are very low and dim. Not a stuffy id buy again for a toddler that would feel safe to use as a flashlight to light up a room. I thought it would shine brighter but that wasn’t the case.
This was the worst buy ever and would ask form$$ back but we didn’t keep the box. Instructions are useless and the material of legos are cheap and not durable like other legos we have bought. If I could give negative stars I would.
"Lexmark E120n Printer was fine till LD Products toner for it was installed. NIGHTMARE!!!....However, in defense of LD Products...Have tried other non Lexmark toner catridges for this printer. And I have had no luck....Lexmark printers in general are not ""generic toner catridge"" friendly"
"Very nice to have this on hand.  Just note, the perforations just mark where you want to cut the bubble wrap, it reduces losing any of the bubble wrap.  This is one product that I will be purchasing again."
"the collar will not stay lit for more than a minute or two. very annoying to have to turn it on again, over and over while walking the dog.I would not buy this again even if the price was lower"
Good sturdy set of boxes. The only issue is the photo of the product on Amazon is the incorrect shape. I’ve ordered these two times now but the photo is wrong. Check the size to know the accuracy of its measurements. Don’t rely on the photo.
"This is absolutely perfect!! I bought 5 for my ShihTzus,  and the fit is perfect! This is the first Sweetwater I have purchased that in totally HAPPY with. I will be ordering more from this company! I very seldom write reviews, but this one I have to."
I was looking for something exactly like this bed! I like how the front side can be folded up or down depending on what I want for my Shih Tzu. Great quality memory foam and super soft fabric. Will buy again!
Great variety and easy to use. I thought the package came with a lot for the price. I had plenty leftover for future events. The balloon garland was very easy to make with the balloon tape. Received many compliments about it.
"Shipping was incredibly fast and I actually received three. Thank goodness because one broke as I was learning to use it and the other got deformed when I finally got it in. It makes a gorgeous bun, but the product is not sturdy enough for multiple uses."
"If your quilt-making is cut, sew, then cut again, you might like this ruler and book. I find this to be only a step above paper piecing. It was expensive, so I recommend you find a way to look before you buy."
"I wish I could upload a pict of it but it I don't know why I couldn't here.... so far very nice earrings, I choose the Green ones , they are beautiful and matches with a lot of outfits. You can use it Morning/ evening/night"
This product is made of quality material. I have been using it for six months and there's no problems. It is a bonus to get two nail clippers. They're sharp and there's a a built-in area to file rough areas on the nails.
Love these dragons and two of three look awesome but the third popped an irreparable hole literally the first time we blew it up. Can’t return just the one and need the other two for a birthday party this weekend
"This is a great, inexpensive, every day paper.  It might be just a tad light for more formal presentations, but I don't think it's designed for that.  This is your every day paper.  I'd order again and again without hesitation."
"Received the package on time, no damages or what ever. This small drone is easy to fly and use even In strong winds. 1 downside is the fixed authorisation area's which you'r not able to change. For the rest a great drone"
"Loved this design for years, and when I finally ordered it, much to my dismay it was way too short. It might as well have been the 3/4 version of a crop top, which I do not look good in. Really disappointed :c"
"My wife: This supports your stomach really well.  I really like how it has two adjustable straps and it feels like it's good quality.She didn't say a whole lot more than that, and since I can't use it I can't add my own 2 cents in."
Won this on Dealdash. I have 4 daughters and 3 granddaughters. So you can't go wrong with Barrel Shack products. I've won several different styles and have received all of them quicker than expected. Very good quality and definitely built to last! Highly recommend.
Love that this is real chicken and nothing else.  My dogs immediately ate it and came back for more.  It's nice to give them a treat that I know is healthy and not filled with a bunch of things I can't pronounce!
"kids like it but tend to get bored with it after a few minutes, it's their least favourite of all their hot wheels sets. the cars don't seem to stay going as well on it and it's not super easy for the to get the cars going"
It makes my teeth very shiny and white and the best part is that it is very sweet. After using this product I feel more confident about my teeth and I smile more often. It not only makes my teeth shiny and white it also protects my teeth.
"I love these hoops!  They are so pretty.  Just the right size, thin and light.  I now have three pair in different sizes.  I would recommend to anyone looking for very thin hoops.  Will buy from this seller again."
"The prettiest charm for a keychain I have ever seen, looked exactly like the picture well worth the money...unfortunately it fell out of my keychain and I could no longer find it, but the seller helped solve my issue! Could not have been anymore satisfied with my order!"
I like the way it flows over my body with a nice flare to it. The material is very soft and the colour is just as it look in the picture. I bought a size too big 1x green but i still  love the look.
"Definitely added some character to my desk. When they shipped it-it is rolled up pretty tight which ends up leaving a bit of a ripple in the pad on one side (perhaps a steamer would remedy this?). Aside from that, I have no complaints."
"Perfect length (to my 5'8 ankles), perfect weight (for southwest climate), perfect sleeve length. Yummy to touch...very soft and velvety. Great hood that is very difficult to find on a long robe. Love this robe and can't wait for it to cool off enough to wear it."
The idea is great but not able to use twist pins for all the spots because of the chairs frame.  I had to go buy some push pins to use.  If it would stay on great protector from our cat.
I purchased the MyPlate stickers as learning tools for a nutrition project I implemented for youth within my county. The youth as well as the adults enjoyed receiving the MyPlate stickers. They are great reminders for us to continue to eat healthy.
The clasp wore out after only a few months of use which came completely off while I was walking my dog.  Very dangerous.  The material and flower is pretty but wouldn’t buy again due to the lack of sturdiness and durability.  Potential hazard.
It is impossible to find these refills anywhere.  They last a long time so every time I use all I have I've had to search to find more.  I was glad to find them on the Amazon website.
I was going through paper towels like crazy and decided to try these bamboo towels and I wasn't disappointed. Definitely a game changer and money saver especially when there's kids in the house. I was impressed how durable they are after washing them.
"We ordered this and the cake topper for my dad’s birthday party. The cake topper was great, but the birthday banner did not have any Beatles on it - just the black Happy Birthday & 2 guitars. If the Beatles cutouts had been on it, it would have been great!"
"I teach EKG interpretation and I am impressed with this tool. It's sturdy, laminated, easy to read and covers many things. Examples of rhythms, arrhythmias and even ST depression, elevation and Q wave formation. Excellent tool for someone starting off."
"I get that part of the appeal for these is that they’re mystery boxes, but I just paid $35 to get one that I don’t already have. The other 5 were duplicates of ones I already have. I wish we could pick the ones we actually want."
Stained my bath tub and burned my skin. The rings inside were not even nice and way too small. Basically a cheap ring with a little colored rock glued onto it. It took me an hour to scrub off most of the dye.
I absolutely love this outfit! Love that it is 2 pieces so I can split it into 3 outfits but it makes an amazing dress too! I’ve gotten so many compliments on it and recommended it to others. Definitely worth the price. You won’t be disappointed in this purchase!
"The banner was about all I could use from this. The balloons would have been cute, but they smelled AWFUL. I had to throw them away because I couldn’t have kids playing with them with smelling of pure gasoline and they left a gross film on my hands."
"Changing my review.  We thought pieces were missing, but we were wrong.  The car works fine.  All of our batteries had drained for some reason, which made us think the car was broken.  Check your batteries, and you're good to go.  Happy kids."
I love this the leash is so comfortable to hold the clip is strong the collar is absolutely adorable on my baby onyx and she loved the ball that came with it as well I would recommend this to everyone
The image would lead you to believe it holds several keys. It's very difficult to get them all installed onto the key Holder. The screws are small so you have to carefully balance all the keys on top of each other to get them installed.
This is the cutest and softest toy we purchased this year (2016).  I love the customer interaction from the company.  The communication is quick and concise. An ideal company to deal with and purchase from all year long.
These are pretty small party bags.  I only say that so you don't think they are big like grocery sacks.  The size is about right for a pinata or something like that (small treats).  The quality is good though - they held up well.
"Not like the others I have purchased. 1) they are slightly smaller 2) the ink comes out weaker on this paper 3) it get bunched up in the Clover Mini, more times, than not. I’ll jump back to other brand."
The cartridges are well-made and give excellent quality print results.  They're WAY less expensive than I could get through a local store.  I have 3 Brother printers that all take this cartridge - I'm a very happy customer.
I had three of these pens (sequentially) and all three failed within 4 months. The retraction stroke on the top began to stick in the pressed-down position. Very unusual for a pioneer manufacturer of the retractable pen.  VERY Disappointing! (No problem with the twist Retro 51's.)
"It came in a day early, which was a nice surprise!  I immediately started using it, and it works amazingly well. I used sanitizing solution and have taken this thing with me everywhere!  I plan on buying more..."
"The tent is made from good quality materials. Its nice and squishy. Downside is that its more padded than I anticipated, which results in much less &#34;cat room&#34;. My cat doesn't fit in there and shows no interest in trying. Bummer."
We ended up sending this back.  There was no door for Mom to come in/out; we used the pen we had with panels (comes in brown or white) and a swinging door. The frame on the whelping box was also flimsy.
"I am really happy with this purchase, these shoes are great for office and for an event. My only complaint is they aren’t the most comfortable to walk in for long periods of time, but as long as you’re not walking all day you’re fine."
Pay attention to the fact that the size chart listed by the manufacturer and the size chart provided by amazon next to the size selection bar are VERY different. This can in no way be considered a dress. It would be generous to call it a tunic.
"The craftsmanship is inferior, the overall shape is not symmetrical. These are not hand crafted and are cheaply made. The mold used is not even straight. None of the segments are of the same length. A total waste of money."
"I’m not comfortable not wearing a bra Nd this gives me that feeling of being held. Nd it’s super adorable Nd it’s soooo comfortable. Cannot stress that enough. Stretches, not to tight or to loose, Nd I’m 175 so yea. Love it."
Love the DIY aspect but it was a little time consuming and tricky.  The sting provides was unraveling due to the tinsel.  I wish the cardstock was thicker.  I was hoping for better quality for the price.
Beautiful cage with lots of room for our Blue/Gold Macaw. Seems to be of very good quality. We really don't care for the door latches but that is something we can change. Easy assembly & item arrived quickly and in excellent condition.
I bought 2 of these as the first one I bought would not get my Traxxas Summit 1/10 tires off the ground. I found another one (this one) and almost sent it back cause it is the exact same size but the threaded stand is taller so it worked great.
"My husband was given this style  baseball cap when he bought his 2011 GMC 3500 Dually.And, I was thrilled to find a replacement cap exactly the same as the original.He still wears the original but sports the new one when we go shopping or out to eat."
"I'm a 32 waist. Got a large, fits perfectly. I'm mostly a medium in most things, so this was a change of pace.Awesome quality shorts. Great look. the pockets are kind of hidden and i dig that. they're short, but not booty-short short. Highly recommend."
"Did not remove stains. wasn't the miracle cleaner it claimed to be. A Chinese company, says it's septic safe on Amazon, nothing indicating it on their website or on the packaging. Since it's Chinese, doubt they are telling the truth."
Stylish hat!  Great craftsmanship and quality from the San Diego Hat Company!  Looking forward to purchasing an array of color choices and styles. . .Foldable and minimal space taken when folded for outdoor adventures. . .  Love this stylish hat!
My dogs love the taste BUT something keeps giving them diarrhea no matter how small a piece I give them.  The Farmland Chicken Jerky treats I have never experienced an issue so I am disappointed that these are not good for them.
"The quality of materials feels great, but on arrival half of the pieces of the mask had already come off. Nothing that some E6000 can't fix, I imagine, but good thing I need this in a couple of months and not tomorrow."
Love it! Little small for my taste but that's ok for me.... it is not that thick but that's also ok for me.... it feels really nice and soft.... I just love it! I will be getting another set for sure.
These are great glasses for the price. Very stylish too! I received an email the day after they arrived from the company making sure I was happy with them. So I would say the customer service is top notch. I'm very pleased.
There was no shark in the box. One of the Pirates was missing his arms. The rowboat did not have oars or the little flag that Clips onto the back. The palm tree was missing the trunk of the tree.
I got this for my daughter for her birthday so I’m just now opening it- the zippers are terrible and with the slightest pressure blow open (regardless of the actual zipper not moving). Super sad because it’s not out of the return period 😩
"I returned this item.  It came in a bunch of pieces and had to be put together.  The instructions were completely in a foreign language, so you had to figure it out yourself.  This item was misrepresented on the website."
"Truly, if this is flannel, the thinnest I've ever seen or felt.  Reminds of you a well loved shirt that becomes brushed cotton over time from wear & washing.  Nothing warm about it, which is what most people get flannel for"
This product yields bright colors and the ink does not smudge! Really good product at a great price. I printed these two pictures on the color setting and the colors are vivid and beautiful! I bought this for my Epson xp6100 and it works with no errors. I highly recommend!!
Good for the price. I prefer them a bit sharper but that can be solved with a few seconds on my belt sharpener. A little bit smaller than you would think but that doesn't keep the opener from getting the job done.
"As described and fits very nicely. The magnets are also opposing so they fit together too, as they should.Word of caution, these are SOFT jaws. They're not hard plastic but more like a firm rubber. Make sure you're getting what's appropriate for whatever workholding you need these for."
"Some like it mushy, some like it dry and THEY like this the best.  (Same as your cats)The price is competitive, so I opt for the door to door delivery. Once you get your cats choice down, this is an extremely convenient way to shop."
This shirt fulfilled my requirements. Like one of the other raters I bought it to match my daughters halloween costume. I bought a medium and usually wear a small. If I had to buy it again I'd go with a small.
I purchased this one and the matching larger one for my daughter's Easter basket.  She loves paint horses.  These are exactly as I had hoped they would be. They arrived in a timely manner and were in perfect shape.
This set was a birthday gift for my 10 year old son.  He enjoyed building it and likes it a lot.  I didn't enjoy vacuuming about 200 of the pieces from my dining room after he was done playing with it...
This stuff is a marvel.  Works as advertised.  Water beads off the page and pencils write smoothly without smudging.  Wish I had something like this 40 years ago.  I often surveyed in the rain back then. Not so much now. :o)
Poorly designed. Cheap materials. The zipper broke after opening it a few times. If it wasn’t for the fact that I need something for my paintings I’d throw it out. And I refuse to pay more to replace it. I would never recommend this
I’ve ordered these pens twice and frankly can’t understand how the order always has issues with quality. The little black cats in both orders came headless!  Frankly I have black cats and so do my friends so it’s disappointing at best.
"I upgraded to the Big size planner this year (from the classic) and was having a hard time finding folders for it at my local shops/stores. Didn't really need the stickers and stuff, but I'll end up using them anyhow! haha Everything is nice quality, as you'd expect from MAMBI."
"My granddaughter wanted her own tank, so she got one for her birthday.  My stock provided her fish, but I had to buy plants to 'naturalize' the habitat.They looked well and worked for her tank, so I bought more to supplement mine."
Works decently there is some knockoff games installed like pokemon blue and red for nes which are just reskin games. Hdmi plug is my only gripe since it loses connectivity on occasion. Only wanted the console to play xenogears on ps1
I have tried every scoop for scoopable liter this is the perfect size to get all the waste out and not leave sm clumps behind. I hate the point on it put I canblive with it. I guess if I wasn't lazy I cut cut it off.
"I confess that I have not tried these for taste…but my cockatiel loves them and he is a picky boi…so I figured if they weren’t good he would’ve left them alone. However, he is a fiend for them. I have to make sure he doesn’t over eat them"
Have been purchasing this brand of dinosaur for grandsons for years and all of them have held up to the wear and tear of playing. Will keep purchasing these for gifts because they are fantastic quality and the kids love them!!
"A very nice basic harness and leash set to keep your pup secure while out and about. The padding that covers behind the arms and up the chest could be slightly longer, as the straps rub a little on my dogs underarms. Overall I would recommend this product."
This only comes with one lift pipe and the plastic on the one is very fragile - I knocked the top bit with the mail plastic part and it snapped one of the little plastic bars - it will work for what I need it for.
Good treats. My dog likes the flavor and they seem to help. He is 16 years old and still moving/ running/ jumping around. If I had any criticism it would be that I wish they were a bit softer...but minor issue
"I'm just curious as to why this version is so high in price. I have the 1st edition. New 10"" Moon Knight that Toy Biz put out in 97 & that's only going for $60. And that's a collector item"
Very flattering although a shaper may be needed.  The dress is not shiny. The material is very comfortable. The split in the back makes it very  comfortable to walk. I got a lot of compliments wearing it to a formal wedding.
The nail clippers are of high quality and made very well. I'm very happy with my purchase and love the fact that there are 2 different clippers for toenail and fingernails. I would highly recommend these and the included pouch is convenient.
"Bought this belt in November 2016 and have used it nearly everyday as a dress belt for work.  Today the leather split apart, unusable now.  Buckle is still working fine.  Have never had a leather belt crack like this.  2/3/2020"
"Peanut Butter Chocolate is a good flavor.  The bars have higher protein and dietary fiber than a lot of protein bars.  Best of all, these protein bars do not upset my stomach.  I will be trying some of the other flavors."
"I’m 5’4 135lbs, bigger chest and short torso so these types of tops are usually hit or miss for me but this one is gorgeous and versatile! I don’t personally like the way it’s tied on the model so I made it a halter"
Item is as shown and described but my complaint is the handle cushions have an extreme strong chemical smell it is not going away. If this smell doesn't go away I'm not going to be able to use the leash
"This product was recommended by my acupuncturist/herbalist. My husband I use it almost every week, and we may only need 1 or 2 doses. It wards off all of the colds/flues of the season and it's great for traveling, to keep the bugs away."
Bought this for an outdoor garden gate to protect a downspout when gate is opened. Also needed a hook to keep it open on occasion. I installed it on a patio brick using the included masonry bolt. It worked perfectly. Very pleased with the design and functionality. Excellent quality.
"Looks great in my 10G! I got this for the shrimp I am planning to get. I can't wait to see them on this. I like that it is hollow and porous, providing places to hide and holes to swim through."
This is cool for bath time.It attached to the wall pretty easy with suctions cups.Then fill it up and let the bubbles come out.  I recommend a bubble bath soap to help it really make a lot of bubbles !
"My youngest son and I love to have those 'friendly' heated discussions about politics.  Since  I have prime, I love to send small gifts to my kids periodically.  This went to my son.  We got a good giggle about it!"
Logo looks great!  Great customer service!  We ordered these to use in our elementary school's computer labs and are used daily by many kids.  These are holding up very well and logo is not coming off at all!
"My dog looks so much more comfortable with this on. She’s not fussing over her cone (or scraping up my legs!) when she naps, she lays on it like a pillow.  Tough material, I doubt she could chew through it. Would definitely recommend!"
"1.The watch band material stands up, but the cross straps broke early on. 2.The stem is hard to pull out for changing time. 3. Having said that, I am well satisfied with the watch mechanism and the appearance, as well as the price."
"Kiddo loves the cord (although it's pretty short), and I swiped the ear thingies... which have made a frustrating pair of glasses that would always slide down my nose uber-comfortable! How has this not always been a thing? Great doodad."
"I adore these, they are super cute and all but they definitely shrink a lot after just one wash so they are a bit of a stretch to use them again but all in all still super cute. Still even reach to above my knees!"
"Our dog has had this for a few months and it has been chewed down, but it has still kept it’s shape (I wouldn’t say it’s indestructible: but it is does work well as a chew stick for our dog.)…"
These are really cool! I use these to hold index cards with important reading info that I needed first graders to be able to grab and put away on their own. They are magnetic and easy to add and remove the index cards. Perfect solution!
Should have read the description more thoroughly. The advertising made it seem like they were multiple dolls. There was one doll and weird paint stuff that comes off when you 1st wet it. Not really a fan for the price. Seems cheap and very small and not toddler appropriate.
I love love love these blank books. I use them for writing my novel. I print out my text and add pictures etc. I also use these for my  year old who loves to draw. Great quality. Nice and sturdy. hard cover. Great for a lot of DIY's
"These are simple, but they are great depending on what you are trying to do. I wanted to make magnets out of champagne bottle top (the little metal piece). I put two magnets per metal piece to give them more height and more strenght and they are perfect."
These file folders are so cute!  I recently changed to a school where the mascot is a tiger.  These are wonderful to complete my tiger themed space!  Well made - don't look or feel cheap.  Shipping was amazingly fast!
Worth every penny. Already used it many times for many kids. Supports well above recommended weight. Very easy set up and take down. Only negative is that it deflates very quick if the hose comes off the blower. Which happens often.
I’ve purchase this shirt twice now for gifts and might get one for myself bc both recipients love it so much! The size fits as expected and the beige is more of a light/blush pink like shown in the pictures shown.
"While a nice idea, what I didn't realize was this module won't load my Palm AFTER a hard reset. I still needed to hot synch to load the MemorySafe &quot;drivers&quot; before the Palm and the module will exchange data.I think it was a waste of money."
"Very cute! Fit to size.  The head piece was a bit too heavy/awkward, so my daughter wouldn’t wear it and there’s glitter on the tutu so I had to shake it out really well before she wore it.  But other than that was very happy with the product."
These are really nice but had to return because they are huge.  I have a Maine Coon cat that weighs almost 20 pounds but this was way too big for him.  They are made very nice and sturdy.
"The wedge is fine, but the pump is worthless.  Took it out of the package and tried to plug it in and immediately the one end of the plug-in came apart.  Keeping the wedge and sending back the pump.  Don't pay extra for the poorly made pump."
"Product was super clumpy making it difficult to add to protein shakes.  If you buy this product, plan on ALWAYS using a blender to mix the beet powder in because a hand held blender bottle doesn't do the trick."
"I love Christmas and the banners looked great.  My only issue was the New Year sign had the incorrect year. Also it gets windy here and the strings to hold the sign up, ripped.  I will need to order new signs."
We bought 3 of these wind up toys since my twins are obsessed with anything paw patrol... I wasn't a fan honestly. The toys don't glide/swi  well through water. They are cute but don't expect much more than the novelty that it's paw patrol...
My dog has a few jackets and this one might not be in the top pick for use I would probably use this on a light cooler day definitely not winter cold days just my take on this jacket but it is made well
I hate fish oil pills because the after taste is the WORST but these fish oil pills are the best! I take them in the morning and don't taste them like I would other fish pills in the afternoon. Highly recommend!
"My kid loves my little pony and mermaids. This puzzle totally delivers. The fact that there are two puzzles in the box is ideal - smaller projects for smaller attention spans is perfect, and it's extra variety to boot. Very happy with this purchase"
"They say they are longer in length I am only 5'6'' and 135 lbs not obese and do not have huge boobs, and they are still short on me. I even went one size larger to get extra length. I hate when my back shows when I bend over..... I"
If I were to give it 0 stars I would all these things do to drain lines is builds up slime in the drain not a fan of these kinds of pan strips at all do not do what it says on the wrapper
"This notebook is great.  I love that I can remove a page or put it in another spot.  I do wish it was possible to buy just the binder without the pages, though.  I have lots of extra pages and no binder to put them in."
"Cute set and the mittens are true to size, but the hat is several sizes smaller than advertised. My grandson is small for his age, but the hat was way too tiny for him. For that reason, I would not recommend."
"Used only once - was a ""miracle cure"" for knee discomfort caused by meniscus damage and Baker's cyst.  Shared with a friend who eventually had knee replacement surgery.  She did not experience the immediate and profound relief the Osmo Patch gave me.  Well worth the investment."
"After putting these together, I realized that I did it wrong, and had to redo them.  Also, days after using them and throwing them away, I realized what the sticky stuff they included was meant for.  Would have been great if instructions for these were included."
To start there is no dislike. And unless a person knows how to write with a fountain pen and also write cursive  90% of today's individuals would not know what to do with this product. In itself it is wonderful.
I bought these from thr Crayola store directly. Waste of money. They are too wet and soaked thru my paper. There is also no glitter. The glitter was the sole reason I wanted these and they failed to need that expectation
"A very affordable, uniquely engineered silver generator...two qualities that rarely go together. Andres was very responsive, answered all mymany questions; he has a great understanding in this area. Simple to operate, easy to maintain, store and clean. 2 thumbs up!"
"It is definitely heard by anyone within 20+ feet of the unit.  I thought it would be inaudible to us, but nope.  Oh and the critters are still around, in fact a chipmunk went into a hole within 2 ft of it."
This sand looks great in my aquarium! It's sparkly and looks beautiful in my fluval chi. It stays much cleaner than gravel and I think the fish like it better too! Just make sure you get enough. This bag is only enough for a 5 gallon tank.
"I have an important tip, you need to hold the button down for 3seconds before it comes on. I use the vibrating bristles to break up my makeup and use the brush part to finish cleaning my face. I love it and highly recommend it."
Great compliment to LEGO space set and Neil Armstrong book for 7 yo. His Mom (an engineer) and I could not get the tabs to connect. Had to call on his Dad—a contractor. Too early to tell how long it holds up.
I really like the smell of this stuff. Also it makes my dog smell good too! This doesn't seem to irritate my dog's skin (he has very sensitive skin). I am giving 4 stars because the scent does not last very long on the coat.
I’m a middle school math teacher and absolutely loved finding and using this poster in my classroom. I love that this poster comes fully laminated! The colorful illustrations are really engaging and help brighten up the room. Definitely would recommend to any other math teachers who teach angles!
I like it but the screw it came with was too small so I have to improvise until I get a larger screw. It was delivered really fast.I just wish it came with the proper hardware to install. My cat likes it. Some what expensive.
"As my son headed back to school, I wanted him to wear a mask that was comfortable and willing to wear. He wears these all day, every day. I bought a second pair so I had time to wash them daily after he wore them. They worked out great!"
Decent cheap wheel and tire set for a slow crawler. If you want to use these on anything with torque and speed you will want to glue the tire to the wheel.I glued them and sealed the hole in the wheel and use them as my water and snow tires.
"The dick is bent at the tip and crocked pointing to the dolls right. The chest is squishier than advertised and has some divots. Overall it still seems usable, but not in perfect condition. I will update after testing on its usability."
Very easy to put on. I have a pug which is a hard dog to fit. It could use an additional size adjustment across the chest. But otherwise it’s pretty good for him. I’m going to order an extra one.
I guess my cat is too smart for this toy. She played with it for 2 minutes and won’t pay attention to it anymore. I think this toy is best for young kittens. My cat is about 16 months old.
Love the variety pack. My morkie loves the squishy ones. She has yet to rip any one the toys which is a bonus but I would be careful if you have a larger dog. Works well with training purposes as well.
"I just opened this, and upon seeing that the food looked different, I looked at the package and noticed it is SENIOR DOG FOOD! As I am no longer able to return it, I am just putting my objection here. However, I would still like a refund."
We have had our Santevia for awhile and really love it.  One thing that has always bugged us was the slow flow out of the old original spout .  This new one makes the Santevia much more functional and easier to use.
I bought these for my granddaughter for Christmas they were not as soft as I thought they would be and the scent wasn't as strong as I thought it would be either. The price was fair for what I received I guess.
It works. It combines good things and makes me feel great. I notice when I’m not using it.. it’s hard to get and annoying that I have to wait weeks until it comes in and that leads me to stop buying it
Horrible product. I didn't realize the battery wasn't working until my dog wandered close to the street. I checked the rest of the batteries and they are all dead. It was 4 days past the date to get a refund. Don't waste your money or time on this product.
A hit with the kids...they each get a different color! We've had them a couple months and use them every day with our smoothies. Colors remain true and they clean well in the dishwasher. We haven't had to use the little straw brush yet.
Bought this for my German Shepard he has only used it once it seems to be made well. The only complaint I have is It is too small my advice to you is if you have a larger dog get the xxlarge.
"Nothing spectacular about this product.  They work as advertised. When you cut your pieces,, just make sure you use something to flatten them out since they will he bent for a bit.  That or a powerful flat metal object will work as well. Would buy again."
"Beau loves it. Only problem is with some staples in the bottom that he caught his claws  on, and the way the sisal scratching surfaces came with threads hanging down so Beau tried eating them like it was grass.I had to trim them to prevent him having digestive issues."
I love cooking with Erythritol.  It measures cup for cup like sugar without affecting blood sugar levels.  I also mix it with pure Stevia extract so I don't have to use as much.This Erythritol is as good as any that I have found and less expensive.
This does work! The only thing is.. is my husky is way more hyper than my Pomchi so she like yanks her around sometimes. So if your dogs are both tame and not super jumpy/ hyper this will work for you. Other than that it’s a great product!
"I love the variety of colors I got! I've put a fair amount of use into mine and switch them often, and there hasn't been any visible wear. The plastic that covers the front of the badge is fairly flimsy, but that hasn't caused any problems for me so far."
These notebooks are pretty good. I bought them to use for work to write down notes whenever a thought popped into my head. They work for the job intended. I received all the notebooks and none of them are defective.
"Sexy fingerless gloves.  I love these.  They are unique, artistic and sexy.  I really enjoy them.  The gloves add personality to any outfit you wear.  It adds a little bling!  I would but again"
"Seems to work well. I can't use the led light, the batteries were dead when it arrived. Maybe it should be packaged different. The product itself seems to work ok. I haven't seen a drastic change in my teeth but it had helped."
"I wanted bookends that are basically invisible and take up as little space as possible. We don't have a lot of storage space and can't waste shelf space on kitschy decorations. These have been perfect for our needs, and they're very affordable & sturdy! Would recommend."
helping someone who is unable to get the drops in her eye without the dropper touching her eye.  This works fantastic with the single dose dropper and she was able to administer the drops herself.  It worked so well I ordered a second one for myself.
Great car door easy to install.  Locking mechanism seems so so... not sure how long that may hold up as occasionally I see some cat paws sticking through to say hello but for the money I don’t think you can beat it
"Great product. I was using Aloe Vera post-radiation on my neck and it stung, as well as feeling like it left a residue. The Madera, whilepricey, did not sting after application and moisturized without leaving any residue. Wish I had discovered it in the beginning."
But it is an important part of keeping their ears clean. I don't want to see them scratching at their ears. I would rather they be in comfort 24/7. It takes two of us to do the job unless I can sneak up on them.
"They have feet that are recessed so it looks like they would stack securely and lock into the corners, but they slip inside and wedge in about an inch down instead.  Gluing acrylic rods in the corners to support them helped, but you shouldn't have to."
"Folder is just as pictured/described but whoever ""packed"" it, just stuck it in the mailer with nothing else to keep it flat so it arrived VERY bent, because it's paper/thin cardboard it can't be fixed it will always look bad.  Be advised."
"Although I have not had the opportunity to use these rubber rings ( one came with the boat ),  I expect to use them when the original one deteriorates.  They appear to be perfect in all respects.  They look as good as the original ring."
"Worst item I have ever purchased from Amazon.  Lousy, makes me leery about purchasing from Amazon.  Brand new cartridges that look like they are running out of ink.  I'll pay the extra money and purchase from a legitimate source, waste of money."
Very satisfied with this purchase. It was easy to set up with clear instructions for running the water until it was ready to use. The water tastes great and I am feeling good knowing that it is doing its job of making sure my water is safe.
"These urns are beautiful. Simple but wonderful details. Please note that 2 out of our 4 urns' tops were stuck on. We tried and tried to twist them off, but it must've been a defect.  However, we contacted the seller and they sent us 2 replacements free of charge."
I was super waited to be getting a 2000 pc puzzle and so was very.upset that the prices were not as thick as advertised. The was no snap into place leaving nothing connected. I didn't even get the frame done it was so bad.
It's a Parker. A little bigger then the originals. Fits the hand better. Unsure of if it's worth the additional cost for a larger size. Time will tell how long the ink lasts. Time will tell how long the pen holds up.
"I got this as a movie prop but the issue is that you can hear it’s fake, and it sounds like nails on a chalk board. It lasted for 2 days until the top came off. I think that this product could become great if they try a bit harder."
The shoe is absolutely adorable! Unfortunately the sizing is way off! I ordered a 5 toddler and it says inside the shoe size 22. When I looked up the conversation chart the shoe is a actually a size 6.5-7 in US?! So I’m very disappointed!
I came into the Rogue One game super like (like a year later) and was super excited to find this Target Exclusive in actual mint condition. He is proudly standing alongside my other Star Wars Pops and I can't wait to get more.
We loves the roominate items we bought two years ago but this one is not made correctly and the structures will not stand but a few minutes. I even put them together for our 8 year old and had the same issues. Very sad this company ruined a great product.
TINY!!  Only those with the smallest frame should even consider!  Didn't like the style in person either. It was like a cheap wide belt with straps sewn on. It reminded me of the back braces they wear in warehouse jobs!
I purchased a medium based on the size chart but it was smaller than a typical medium. I would have kept if it was the right size. I recommend if you go a size up. I needed for a gift and ran out of time to get a new one.
This item is awesome!!! It is perfect for tired/achy neck and shoulders. I heat it up in the microwave to warm it after a long day of work. If anyone you know suffer from neck and shoulder pain this is the gift for them!!!!
"This watch band seems well made. But, the pin and band are both too wide to fit a 23 mm Citizen Eco Drive watch.  I did confirm to size with Citizen, and ended up buying a new 23 mm band and pin from a local jewelry store."
Perfect addition to the dinosaur fleet. The Ankylosaurus is one of our favorite dinosaurs. This one is really cute and detailed. Not too large- which is good when you have a fleet of these guys. My great nephew likes Imaginext best of all dinosaurs.
I love this scent and I'm so happy I found it on Amazon. They don't really sell this scent anywhere else in its own. It comes in a with the automatic dispenser.  You only get one and it costs like $15 so this DEFINITELY beats it. Thank yoi!
"My four year old is really into bug catching and she thought this was perfect. The only part we didnt like was the retractable container, it falls apart pretty easily. But all in all its a great gift for a little girl with a love of Bugs."
"Does not work. Not sturdy. Didn't last 2 days in normal weather. Rehung it, still did not make either of my dogs stop battling. Didn't phase them one bit. BIG waste of money! Don't even waste your time reading any more about it"
"Get ready to progress/gag. This stuff is rancid but effective af. Kid you not though, it's inedible. I put a shot of water in it and just throw it back and chase it with a spoonful of peanut butter. The price of beauty...."
Love the effect of these. I got the blue ones and I attached them to the frame rather than the wheels. No excuse for drivers to not see you with these. Would be nice if the battery pack was smaller but I'll manage.
"Loved this collapsible food container and the touch button opener. So disappointed when after only three weeks of opening it gently twice daily, one of the molded plastic hinge pins cracked off. Wish the pins were made from metal like the springs are. It would last longer."
"These are the only treats my wife's cats eats.  Give them anything else the dogs end up eating them.  Its funny because they like them so much they have learned to beg for them.  You can't lose with these treats, your cat will love them."
"An unusual number of pieces were still attached to each other - and it was difficult to separate some without tearing the paper backing.  Otherwise, this was an interesting challenge due to the mixture of colors across the entire surface."
"Very sturdy well made bowls, unfortunately, they didn’t work for our cat.  We were looking for shallow wide bowls due to her long whiskers so she would finish the food in the bowl.  These didn’t work for her."
THE ALBUMS ARE NOT VERY GOOD..  THE FLAP DOES NOT COVER THE OPENING.  COINS HAVE  DROPPED OUT OF THE CAVITY. BECAUSE OF THE FLAP.  ALSO HALF OF THE ALBUM  THE PAGES ARE BACK LOADED AND FRONT LOADED..  POOR QUALITY.
3 year old grandson is a HUGE airplane and lightening mcqueen fan so this made perfect sense.  It's really sturdy looking... about  3 1/2 - 4&#34; long and grandson loves it.  I will update should new info seem useful.
"It snatched my whole soul. Its easy to clean and when I say you'll have the best orgasm of your life, I mean it. You may never want to have sex with anyone else ever again because this does such a great job."
"My wife wears about a 6.5 women's and the small fits just right, maybe a tad snug, but she is comfortable in them all day. If you have anything larger than a 6.5 women's foot you'll need larger than the small."
A bit large in the waist and too long but I took it in and hemmed the skirt.  The color is gorgeous.  Haven't worn it as of this review but I expect to get many compliments.  I love it.
It galls me that it is often cheaper to buy a new printer than it is to spring for brand name toner. This four pack is a terrific value. It works without issue. Printer functions well and the print is clear and consistent. Great buy.
She's a chewer so she goes through them quickly if I don't stop her from eating it. Otherwise she's become very good at catching these flying discs. She enjoys to carry it with her even if not going to play station
Not much to say other than it’s quite entertaining. It sits on top of my fireplace so I can flick it every once in a while. People who come visit give it a weird look and I love seeing their reactions when they finally push it.
Fairly easy to put together. It fits nicely in the corner. Three of the cats were right on it. Now it is a race to see which one gets to the round nest first!  I am very pleased. It seems very sturdy and is really popular!
My PC TECH installed the card scanner. I bought it with the software license. it only read one side and did not scan the name. I returned it to Amazon. all the 5 star reviews bought it without the software license.
"This are probably the best ink/pencil erasers on market.  I keep one in the garage in order to make changes on erasable labels which identify boxes and shelves. and of course, one in my desk to remove the many mistakes I make on paper"
This stuffy is cute and the sequins are pretty. I'm very unhappy with the fur used for the mane and tail. Feels very flimsy and poorly constructed. The fibers pull out easily. We've had this stuffy for a little over a month and the mane looks like it's balding.
I purchased this product to help me with my joint pain. I have only been taking it for couple weeks but already noticed great improvement. I also like that it comes in gel cups because I really don't like hard pills anymore. I am very happy with my purchase.
We used the product when we were moving to wrap around furniture with drawers and doors. It adhered well but a roller to use as you go around and a cutting edge would have been nice. It was impossible to tear and difficult to hold while cutting.
I have one in my kitchen to sweep up the crumbs and another in a craft area. Someone said they are fragile - not true - they are the perfect size for these small jobs. I'm very happy with them
"I bought this for my mom and she loves it! She wears it all the time for jammies, and sometimes just throws jeans over it to go out in public. She's a tall lady (5'10&#34;) and a bit plump, and it fits her a little loosely. Great purchase!"
"These pens were pretty much what I expected. They worked well for a couple of sentences but then they start to fade and then altogether stop working. My experience was bad, so I suggest you go with other pens because these didn't work well for me."
"Basically as described but a lot smaller than expected, i have very small hands and they are tight on my hands. The cuffs are very long and since they are smaller than expected, this makes it uncomfortable on the wrist."
"I only use it to feed the fish when I go on vacation. Uses very little battery power, which is a good thing. Since it drops the food straight down, it's much neater than the ones with a rotating barrel."
"I literally shaved my standard poodle one and 1/2 times, and it just quit working. I have owned it for 2 months. It worked really well, was quiet, and my dog loved it. I am SO disappointed in this product. I oiled it properly and did nothing to damage it."
"Though our dog will TRY to chew on this mat, he doesn't.  Yeah!  He'll pick it up, and rearrange it along with his food bowls, but seems like he just won't chew this mat up.  Fit perfectly in our cage (24&#34; wide) with his bed."
"I wear this shopping since normal face masks don't let me breathe. This one does. Furthermore, I am a wearer of glasses, and I use this as a rain shield when going to and from the car during rain and it keeps my glasses from getting wet. Win/win."
"These don't stick for more than 5 seconds.  so disappointed!!!!!  I'm only using them for work notes on my desk, not even vertical or hanging off of something.  My ceiling fan constantly blows them off my desk."
"Built nice, but the piece of wood that holds the checkers in place as you drop them in does not stay in place well, if you accidentally nudge the game the Stick will come out of place and cause the checkers to drop out."
"I really like this planner. I'm using it for our homeschool. There's information (fractions, types of government and legislature etc) in the first few pages. The outside is super cute and I love that the daily pages list: language arts, science etc sections to fill in assignments. A+"
[[VIDEOID:85b460b5ae0b81ddc902d02c6b029dd7]] Your kids will think it is their own robot- they love it! Gently kick it and watch it hover & glide across the room. It lights up & batteries were included! Lots of fun! A great way to play soccer indoors :)
"I got this for my bf who is a huge Vegeta/Dragonball Z fan, and he loves it. He’s never opened it, so I can only assume it looks good, but the box is really nice with all glossy sides, and no cellophane windows."
They we're beautiful andbibloved them but when I looked at size chart online it digested I buy a small for my waist line measurement and they were so small it hurts to wear them. Of course it didn't notice this till I washed them.
Liked the color and thought it would work like the original Bug Bite Thing. Tested both on several people (blind test). This product Failed compared to the Bug Bite Thing.  I can’t find the tester so I can’t return.  A WASTE OF MONEY.
"Great product, switched to from Polyplabs polyp extender.The expiration date is only a month and year, not month/day/year... This product has only been out for less than two years, you literally can't have one that expires in 2019 because it didn't exist.I dose mine when feeding Rod's food."
"This company really worked with me. I was hesitant to order an engraved sign online.  They made it so easy . They sent preview pics and asked me questions, great communication and great product !  Will use these folks again !"
Their pills what can you say about them I’m taking these pills since 1974 and searched around every place trying to buy them I live by them that’s all I can tell you they’re healthy did they keep me healthy
"Purchased this ink to replace my canon ink cartridge, not sure what happened but after a few uses my canon printer told me that the ink was no longer recognized, replaced it with a new one and it seems to be working for now."
"Had been looking for something deep enough to hold my dip jars and this is it. The movable dividers allow different sizes of jars to fit. The latches holding the layers together are sturdy, even if the side walls flex."
The box was pretty chewed up on delivery. T here was only one white suction cup and one black suction cup in the box and they were loose.  Was this a return from a previous customer that was never checked? Hmm.  Returning it .
Is quite difficult to work.  Makes a mess until you get the hang of it.  Doesn't really seem to clean as well as I thought it would.  I'd spend more on a more sophisticated water flosser next time.
Used it hold my front door open. Install was pretty easy with the included template. Predrilling with a small bit is helpful especially if you have a composite or metal door. Will see how it weathers with the upcoming winter.
"These are nice but they fall off no matter how tightly I tighten the straps.  I just stopped walking my  dog in the summer.  A bit expensive, but good quality if you can get them to stay on your dog!!"
Perfect have an eBay business and when I ship a card these are perfect magnetic so you don’t need a screwdriver to get into the case I love them for my business on eBay thanks Krazy Jacks Surplus sales LLC
Would likely have been a 5 but the squeaker to it down one for me bc my boy dog is obsessed with them and it drives us crazy 😜 Out lasted other toys by a few weeks and still kicking it!
"bags seem to be stronger than I expected.  Only negative is they are not packaged in easy to use container.  folded in box with about 8 together, so you have to take out a bundle, open then peal off what you want."
Does work okay when plugged in but even with brand new batteries will not work without the cord. This is disappointing because my son wanted to be able to take it on trips with him as he is an art fanatic.
"At first I wondered if I had to put a dog in the bottom compartment, but then I noticed that the dog in the photo was photoshopped in and wasn't really there at all. Okay, I said, I don't have to get a dog."
My GSD puppy is teething. At this point he has yet to destroy it. It is easy to attach to his collar and the padded handle is easy to hold onto when he decides he want to go puppy crazy.
"I first got this toy for my oldest granddaughter and have since gotten it for our second granddaughter.  By putting the prince and/or princess' feet in several ""footprints"" the characters can dance, open gates, etc.  It is a fun toy."
"The quality of wood, carving and dye is not especially high, but the set overall is stylish and impressive. The pieces are large and nicely weighted. I can tell that playing with this set will be fun. I'm curious to learn if the blue dye fades over time."
"Our dog loves this mat! My only recommendation would be to pick up the mat as soon as they are done licking everything off. Our dog tore it up pretty good, when we didn't take it away. It's a good thing it comes with two. :)"
My grand daughter loves these sets.  she wore these the day they came in.  She especially loves the heels and the skirts.  Does not come with a top/shirt but everything else.  I would recommend and your little princess will be so happy.
So very beautiful!  Dragonfly design is so fun. Purchased for sister’s Birthday and she soooo loved it. It was delivered on time for her big day even though it wasn’t promised by that date. These cards are super nice and great quality.
"I was enticed by the name of honey and almond and took one smell and threw it away. So many options out there better than this, WAHL actually has some great shampoo I’d recommend instead that I bought after smelling a friends dog!"
These earrings are so flimsy. Every time I put them on I was afraid they would break. Low and behold my 3 year goes in for a hug and accidentally tugs on the earring. It completely bends and breaks off.
The zipper broke off bag literally started falling apart the entire zipper and every metal piece just fell off bag one by one I will be calling to try and get refund please don’t waste your money on this product I can’t even close the bag now
"I'm very disappointed. No instructions in the box, and the balloons do not stay inflated. I had to you other YouTube sites, and it's still not working. I made a sacrifice to get the machine and I can't even use it."
I have to agree with everyone's comment about the bad markers. All I did though was call Crayon and they sent a new set for free and they worked great. I'm just trying to figure out how to replace the solution in the eraser.
"Longer than most, so I don't get that ""cutting off"" restriction feeling.  Helps move excess fluid away from my knee when it's swollen.  Washes well.  I actually have two of these, one was getting pretty well worn after two years, so I just purchased a second."
"I wear a 38 D normally  and these were too small to fit correctly around my chest.  the XL does not fit around 38 inches, it binds and rolls up.  But they were made well otherwise and I believe would be comfortable to wear."
"I was not sure about these when I ordered them, but now I love them. A great product. Well made. Very durable and a look of quality. I get comments about them all the time. They are the best. I highly recommend them."
"Love the design but very thin. I saw where one customer used panty liners for protection, excellent idea also it will slide off your face. I use a thin or small hair clip behind my head and it works great!"
I haven’t used the adding machine tape yet so I can’t speak to anything but the shipment arrived as expected. I will attempt to do a follow up review. I’m sure it will be fine but I want to do this review right.
"Huge Harry Potter fan, but the designs of these stickers are kind of dumb and not too day planner useful!!  A couple “birthday” stickers and that’s about it.  The theme stickers for just special touches are pretty lame."
"Compared to other sports hydraters, Vega measures up. I used this after all day volunteering and needed something to restore energy. It has a light fruit taste and I think for the amount you get, good price. I would recommend."
"I began ordering these bully sticks 3 months ago. My puppy loves them. The problem is that each time they come they are smaller and smaller and yet the price keeps going up. I will not order them again. Too bad, it used to be worth the high price!"
Very disappointed. It appears that the pictures must be a small model wearing a large size.Otherwise that beautiful drape the pictures show is unattainable.Wasted my money on the shipping for this.Honesty would require stating size of model and size of vest.
"Bought a 2x. Let me warn ya, its not made for big boobs. Material is way too flimsy. Started ripping from the &#34;oh so not sturdy&#34;waist band. Sending it back right away. Its not even 50percent true to size. It deserves no stars , actually"
"These earrings are super cute and good quality. I've purchased three pairs already so I can have them in all my piercings, and I get so many compliments. I shower/workout with them and haven't turned colors after a few months. Get these!"
"The past few times I’ve been ordering pre workout from BPI, the flavor and consistency just hasn’t been what it used to be. Not sure if the formula is different, if the product is old, or what but this just didn’t cut it for me."
"this belt is perfect it is big so you can cut it your waist dimensions. I have the waist 36 and the size chart have 36-42 waist, belt it is biger and inside the little box is the direction how to install the belt and trimmer"
"this desk is great I put it together alone and didn't really have any problems. The direction where a little confusing when putting the wood together. However, if you mess up it designed in a way that it wouldn't show. The height is great. its definitely worth the buy."
"Advice here is to ""contact the seller"" to get a template to print with. But I don't see how to contact SBLabels. I googled and found an SB Labels in the UK - but they aren't the seller. What is the email or URL for the seller?"
Purchased this for my nephew when he comes to visit and he loves it. Hours of fun!  Easy to install and clip to door. It's Nerf they have been around forever and make great products. I would highly recommend this product.
My first use last night and I was very impressed.  I have always used electric toothbrushes.  However just the ones that you buy at the store.  This was my first one I purchased online.  Noticed an immediate difference after one use.  Highly recommend!!
Absolute piece of trash. Every element of this toy is utterly frustrating. I’ve lost two hours of my life trying to get this to work properly. If I can leave negative stars I would. Save your money and buy a paperweight instead.
I didn't really care about the design on the box.  I was more concerned that it was sturdy and that my pills wouldn't fall out.  It is durable and gets thrown around in my purse all day every day.
"While this hat does provide amazing sun coverage, it has a total bucket shape which is a very unattractive look on me. If you like bucket hats, this is your hat. Otherwise, I do not recommend. The hat does not have a wide brim look as pictured."
"Exactly as promised – these flags look great at our neighborhood pool!  Just in time for swim meet season.  Glad I replaced the old ones at the pool, which were looking cracked and funky from past Summer seasons."
"My boyfriend had to mail some of his buddy’s things to him, who just happens to be petrified of spiders. We hid some of these in the boxes and when he opened them he screamed, stumbled, broke the pictures hanging up behind him, and ran away. 100% worth it"
"This product is the perfect midsized sanitizer. Easy to use and easily sanitizes larger items like bedding, couches, counters, car interiors etc. much faster than smaller ones. Love that it adds an extra level of protection from Covid and many other germs."
"Not a sweatshirt, thin material. Fits tighter than expected- I order and XL thinking it would be bigger and baggy and it is NOT. It’s almost an uncomfortable fit. Color was way off, it’s a mustard, not tan. Not even close to tan."
"Love these for an extra classy touch on my shopping bags, mailers and other items.  Great price for 1500 plus the 3 styles are versatile.  Kraft paper background goes with everything from solid white tissue to printed poly mailers."
"Usually wear a small and this was a little snug, i wanted it to fit like the model picture- probably should’ve ordered a medium to achieve that style. Hoping it doesn’t shrink more in the wash. If you’re thinking of buying order UP. Still nice, material thicker than It looks"
"This is in no way a harness that will contain a dog over 5 lbs.  it's a cute costume, and that's the best I can say about it.  Runs very small.  To return will cost half what you pay for it."
This is the best roller ball pen I have ever found.  I seriously cannot write with any other pen now that I've been using this one.  The ink flows steady and thick.  I have a panic attack when I can't find my pen!
"I ordered a cheap ring to wear to work, so I wasnt expecting much, but 4 stones have fallen out in 2 weeks. The ring is pretty and fit well, but I had hoped it would hold up a little longer. You get what you pay for."
"This thing is nice and heavy and spins smoothly. If you get it spinning and then wiggle your hand that's holding it, it feels cool. It looks more grown up than most fidget spinners and would look cool on a desk."
All three of my cats took to it right away. Thankfully! Works pretty quietly and I know when water needs to be added because it gets a bit louder. That may not be intentional by the manufacturer but helpful. I would recommend purchasing.
"I ordered this bed for my adult cat and found out the area that is where the pet lays was way too small.  It was a waste of my money, so I gave it away to a small dog owner."
So cute and fun for the family. I love how each member of the family has a slot to fill in their activities for each day. I will buy another for 2019! My kids love the stickers they can put on each month.
I wish I would have watched the customers video review before purchasing I really needed the rainbow color pinata not teal and pink. I am waiting for a response back from Pretty Party Place to see if I can exchange. If not I will just get creative and alter it.
"This really helped with my dogs, I don't leave it on all the time because it does seem to go off with just loud noises as well but I do use the test anytime my dogs bark and it instantly stops them!"
"came as ordered , looks great and easy to use , no problems with it , I  just should have gotten a thicker gauge than 60 for the chemical boxes that I ship. will order again but a thicker gauge"
"I hate playing a game in MTG, that no players are getting good cards especially playing commander. I like the fact that I can get good cards to make the game end quicker. The only thing I hate about this card is that this card gets naturalize easily."
"At first I liked the idea, that zippers do give you more options of usage. One zipper broke apart, so the seat cover is not of use anymore. In addition the zippers were covered with a piece of plastic, which got chewed up by the puppy."
It was far larger than the size it says it is I might as well just throw a laundry bag over it my kennel and cut a hole in it looked horribleNot black either it was a weird green and navy color with cheap white zippers
Difficult to use! I thought maybe the kids were just having a hard time but I really had to use a lot of pressure to make any marks with the scratch sticks. The leaf shapes were pretty but the kids couldn’t really do the project. Such a shame!
"If you always forget to buy a new planner at the beginning of the year, this undated planner is great! Breaks down your day by the hour and has sections for adding personal and work goals for the month. I love it"
The slits in the shorts are kinda high and you can see through the side so I advise.wearing them with panties or just at night. Unless you dont care bout that sort of thing. Other than that the set is fab.
"Keeps my Yorkie from ruining my leather seats.  Easy to remove if I have a human passenger, and easy to reinstall for the dog to return to his throne.  Fits well in my Mazda CX-5.  Great price!"
"This top is cute and well made! Slightly larger than I normally wear, but I’d rather it be too loose than too tight. I’m 5’3 and weigh 145lbs and bought a large. Buttons are sewn on nice and look to hold up in a wash."
This worked great and was exactly what I needed to extend my dogs run that we have. We’ve had it for a few months now and it stays outside in all weather and so far has not rusted. Definitely worth the purchase.
"This would be fine for hanging on the wall or fridge, but I was using it as a blotter on my desk.  It is puckered and the top and does not lay flat, which makes it hard to write on top of."
"It arrived on time, and in the original Waterman box. By the finish of it and first usage it seems smooth and genuine Waterman pen. I am happy that I did not receive a corporate pen with no company emblem/space for logo on it.Thank you!"
"This binder is the perfect size for keeping track of my important, most used files at my home office. It's also nice enough to bring to meetings, etc. Very professional looking without overcomplicating it with calculator cases, phone cases etc. Compact and streamlined!"
"These are a game changer,  so much cheaper than the refill packs.  I rated 4 stars only because it's a little complicated to figure out how to load them,  but once you get it it'll be easy ."
"Oh so adorable, he loves it!Light weight perfect pricing, hope it washes well will update if not.Fits well 18 lbs size large Bichon/MalteseNow he can brag about the sisters he’s in love with his puppy as I joke.Definitely worth a purchase and I would purchase again!"
I bought it for my husband and he doesn’t like it.  He would rather an XL size instead of the one size fits all because it feels small to him.  Also the straps are not long enough.  I have to tighten them for him.
I always write my list of clients with their finish times to stay on time.  I love the back leg so it can stand up easily or lay down to write. It wipes clean like a dream and looks great.  I love it! ❤️
"These are not the right size for my Rolodex unfortunately. I’m quite disappointed that I can’t use them. They don’t bend. They have enough different styles that I can use a set for one business, another design for another business, and another design for personal."
I have metatarsal problems and I wear these a little higher towards the toes when I am home to open up and stretch the metatarsals and it helps immensely to cure the problem and give me relief. Great product stays put.
I like how this heating pad has a soft brushed fabric side and a smooth side. The blue is a nice deep color. I had this pad for at least 3 years but the controller stopped working. I loved it so much I bought the same one again!
The case offers far better protection than the bag the drone came with. The removable sections make it highly customizable for additional gear/supplies. Working in a desert the sun shield helps even with winter days to allow the screen to be bright and visible.
Our cats do not scratch these ever. Great protection. However it started a game of whack-a-mole with our cats. They are now scratching anywhere there is no plastic. They even have scratch posts but for some reason they prefer scratching our couches. Oh well. At least the sides are protected.
Picking up half gallon milk cartons is hard for me. I have arthritis and my fingers are not strong enough to hold a full carton. Adding this handle is just what I wanted. It slides on and it’s secure. Simple!
"I liked the different tones of color to choose from. I gave it 4 stars only because the lowest brightness setting to the next highest is a huge difference! Other than that, it’s great for simulating the sun during these bleak winter months."
"This is the best summer shoes to get. You won't regret. Easy to put on and take off. No blisters, no slipping toes forward, straps don't cut into your skin. It doesn't tire out your feet. Looking into buying more of this brand of shoes."
This antler is a good chewing item for puppies who love to chew. My older dog loves it too. This does not wear down like some chews or like a rawhide. It is a good size for my small dog (15 lbs)
"Bought these to try out since I recommend them to friends as an alternative to de-clawing.  They worked beautifully, my cat was unsure about them, but didn't attempt to take them off too much after the first day.  Certainly made giving her baths easier while they were on."
"Not a bad value but on the thin side. I was hoping for something with thinner lines on the pages, so I could get more writing in. The price was good and I liked the colors but the usability isn't what I wanted."
This is one of the few things that my dog can play with for a while before he chews it up. It has a squeak and a tough exterior- a great combination. I bought 2 so far and probably will buy more.
My son usually wears 9-12 month clothing. We ordered a 12-18 month romper just to be safe. We could just barely button the thing but the second he moved or sat down all the buttons would pop. It was ridiculously too small and there is zero stretch to the fabric.
"This is my second set of these dice. I prefer them over the other brands I have as they are easier to ""read"" due to better color coding. Also, I like the rounded corners. These just seem to be of higher quality than my other sets."
"Pretty, but had a horrible smell out of the package. Cheaply made and much shorter than what the picture shows. It did fit as expected size wise, I wouldn’t recommend it, if you want to wearing  with leggings or with a long tank."
"These are cute, although a little on the small-ish side.  Unfortunately, when I had the party store inflate them with helium for me, two of them would not float... she told me the balloons were too heavy for the helium."
I started using this product a few days ago.  I received the sample at a promotional price.  It already started working and I am not experiencing any weird side effects.  The package came fast and was in very secure packaging.  I will definitely buy again
"I had a bigger version of the bracelet and spent the day in my brother's warm salt water pool - the seeds started sprouting! Definitely authentic. Great looking bracelet as well - I love ordering from Shaman's Market, they always have great products."
"I like the ability to carry more than one bag and to stow the full ones.  In spite of having the clip break on my previous two bags (purchased elsewhere), I'm still getting a third.  It would be a 5 if it had a durable clip."
"Got this shirt for the boy for a trip to Miami, it worked very well. He's a usual Medium. I got him a medium. He said it was a nice moisture wicking fabric, cool colors. I liked it, he liked it. 5 Stars!"
"This is such a cute pen! It writes well and I love the erasing feature, it works really well.  I also ordered some rilakkuma note pads and am going to sew a cute little organizer to put them in, this will look great in it."
"As a family with a deaf individual and kids who kept locking themselves in the bathroom, this has saved us from many an awkward moment. It installed easily and is holding up well to use by kids who aren't at all gentle with it."
"I’m usually not a fan of scented bath products, but this was fabulous.  I only used about half a pack in the bath and that was plenty.  Very fine salt, and it gave an instant bright yellow splash.  Super fun.  My skin feels so soft!"
"I got these to put around the house in places where we need extra protection from our toddlers. I like that they are transparent so they aren't very noticeable. The glue seems very sticky, and they've hold their place since we installed them without any issues. So far so good!"
"This model accepts standard 1"" diameter ball markers (my previous Pitchfix model only accepted smaller 7/8"" diameter ball markers - not easy to find).Purchased this tool to replace the previous model whose opening spring had broken after years of use.Very satisfied."
"I was expecting a plastic sheet for the price and was so surprised when this came and it was a beautiful shiney satin. It is large, the picture is great and the material will last for years. Very impressed with this."
"I used them for a bday party the bday sign is a good size all the balloons worked great! No holes, no problems inflating. I would say if you have a hand pump that’s easier to inflate everything including the Sign."
I did like this product.  It was easy to use.  A little over a year after purchasing it the mop head has snapped off. I only used it 2 or 3 times a month so it wasn't over used. I will look for a sturdier replacement.
These poop bags are so durable. They also have a smooth texture so they slide out of the poop bag holder very easily without ripping. They have plenty of room to tie off the top when you are done using them. It was a great value.
"I absolutely love this pet bowl! It’s perfect for my kitty and is large enough to hold his food for the day. I love the design and it’s very aesthetically pleasing, comes neatly boxed in Lenox packaging and is very giftable."
Works really well for scrapbooking. I had previously purchased the white one and enjoyed it so much I decided to get the black as well. It does splatter a bit when you write with it but such is the nature of a fine tipped paint pen.
"I've been looking for a comfortable writing pen for a long time now, and I think I finally found it. Very comfortable to hold, especially with my big fingers. I would recommend at least taking this one out for a test drive, just keep your hands off of mine."
Very disappointed--picture is misleading.  Picture looks like a bunch of pretty flowers in the box but there is almost no color on mine and you can't tell they are flowers.  Does NOT look like the Amazon picture at all.
"Really like the power these have over the weak OEM that came with the Hubsan H107's (Both 'C's an 'L's) Get the 4 or 5-battery chargers too, charging one-at-a-time is silly. If you get two-sets, by the time one set drains, the other is charged!"
"I bought this for my nephew for Xmas, because he likes Sonic. I was kind of disappointed when I’ve received it. I thought the quality looks kind of cheap.I was expecting for better quality because  I paid for $33 and now it’s only $25 :("
"Not so thin it easily knots up.  Not too heavy or so long they're halfway down the street a head of you.  Good for rambunctious dogs who need enough leash to give them their head sometimes, but not so much they drag you away."
The doll us super cute. I got one to see if it looks like the picture. It was so cute that I had to order another one in a different color. I used it as a display on a window cushion.
I ordered this for my office and I love it.  The colors are very vibrant.  It's a mouse pad so it does what I need it to do.  I think it is a great value for the money.
Nice night light. Has a plastic back where the lights come out so this is not really for cuddling but it’s a great night light. Smaller than an average pillow pet but again it’s not really for sleeping on it just has that same shape as a pillow pet.
"There's nothing wrong with the quality, but it really isn't unisex. The fabric portion of the mask is really big. Perfect for a man's face, but it's not adjustable to tighten the fabric as needed to fit a woman's. Wish it was, I love hollow knight!"
"The packaging was unremarkable, but the little guy was strong!!! charged about 30 min to a full charge, then tested it on the wife. Pulled her hood back, turned it on to the lowest setting, and watched her climb the walls!  she's hooked."
"These bullet connectors come in very handy when using some of the smaller gauge wire used in some mini quad builds. The plating makes them very easy to solder, the fit between the two pieces is perfect and they make maintenance a breeze.They are truly indispensable in my quad builds."
"When I received this it was not powder pink, but neon dark pink and did not match my desk set. I was ignored twice by the seller and am stuck with this it seems. Likewise it does not hold your document very well and lets it fall over."
"Couldn't use the small size for my 13 lb dog even tho I measured before I ordered. These seem very ""sturdy"" but couldnt get them on my dogs feet. Ran out of time to return them. Order a size up."
"Easy to install & haven’t broken after a few months of use. They are comfortable on my nose, but they are very soft. If I accidentally hit the nose pads, they would break.  They could be a bit better material, but they are still functional."
"These feel like a rubber band on your finger! Water and air get trapped under them and your skin under the band gets all pruned! If you work with water, sweat, or in a high moisture area this is not the band."
"Me encanto 😍, exacto como en la foto ,  hay que seguir los pasos , me costo un poco armarlo , lo amé , justo necesitaba esto , no me faltó ninguna pieza , y trae de más por si pierdes algo , buena compra 👏👏👏"
This is a great product. It smells great and rinse out great! When I was grooming full time this is the only line I would use. I glad that I can get it on Amazon so I can continue to use it on my own pets!
I was very skeptical to buy this product seeing the reviews were so little however I took a chance. I am very satisfied with the quality and packaging of this product. I end up buying three packs to give to my family and friends.
The L/XL is the same size or possibly even bigger than the 3X. I really like the look and feel of these leggings if only they would fit. I'm well aware these run small but the smaller size shouldn't be bigger than the larger size.
I use the Staples version of this planner every year but was bored with black. I love this color. It is shiny and copper. I was expecting it to be more brown and was delighted when it showed up and was copper metallic.
I bought this for one of my best friends for her birthday and she absolutely loves it! She uses it as here bed comforter. It is super duper soft and it is very large so you can bundle up in it.
This vitamin has great products inside it and i think has assisted me in my vision.  I experienced serious retina detachments and tears with damaged rods and cones.  But the ingredients in this item i believe has assisted me in leading a more normal life.
Edit: I was sent a replacement pump and it seems to be working just fine again. I’m hoping this one lasts longer than the first!Pump broke in 3 months. Food is too close to the water and gets stuck in filter.
"The unicorn balloons are tiny and cant be filled with helium, comes with 2 straws to fill the little unicorn balloons but its confusing because they were in the baggie for the cake decor? 1 balloon had a hole. Was not impressed with this package."
"Not only is the size L too small, but the material is so cheap & has no stretch to it!  I will Donate it to the pick up service for the needy. It was only $10.00 & not worth the trouble to return it!"
"[[VIDEOID:351be9a276380a229ef08191b8365339]] Yes, you too are awesome!  This amazing little journal full of inspiration was given to me by my speaking coach Carol Cox with Speaking Your Brand.  Here's to your success in business and life!  Karen Briscoe, 5 Minute success podcast and author"
The design was exactly what I was looking for for my little girls nursery. It does how ever feel a little ceaply made and I had to buy an arm cover so it didn't look so cheap. It does what it needs to do though.
This was a gift for my granddaughter.  It fit her doll perfectly and she loved it.  Shoe booties did not fit over shoes but that wasn't a big problem.  She wanted me to make the outfit but this was so much easier!
"This is fun to sculpt.There are a lot of bits to place on the sand. They can crowd the sand, so I prefer to only use a portion of the pieces at one time. There’s enough variety to always have a different setup."
"Very good quality, very sturdy,  I was able to put all of my cards in this book and I still have lots of room. I purchased two ang gave one as a gift.  I would purchase again If needed."
"These are durable and colorful. I have used the navy blue in my swim cardio class and it has not faded or stretched or become unwearable. The colors are deep and lasting, and the bands are easy to put on my fitbit. For the price, these are a bargain!"
"I’m sure these are great little spirals, but we did not pay attention to the sizing. We needed the 8” x 11” spiral. These are very small. But we are keeping Because they will definitely be used for another purpose"
This board does not stain when you are using the dry erase markers. This board loves it and was definitely made for it. Great size as well...not too big or too small. Just perfect. You will love this purchase. I definitely recommend.
"every lapidary-ist should have this template, it's perfect for drawing Cabachons on mineral slices for cabbing. I'm sure there are a thousand other uses for it, but that's what I wanted it for and I'm very happy with it  :O)"
"They messed up big time, first they sent me a S not a 8 so I couldn't even use it.  Second there was no way to blow it up. It was a complete mess so I had no number 8 for my daughters birthday.  Very disappointed."
My daughter loves everything Elmo. But not this one. The blanket is somewhat fragile and I have had to reattach it twice. I should have thought about the fact that it would be still and fragile therefore cannot be slept with. It is not cuddly.
These are super thin and there is a strange oil smell to them once I took them out of the plastic and even after washing off with dawn. Doggos aren’t interested in drinking from them and they don’t look like they will hold up well anyways.
My daughter got this as a Christmas gift. She had just turned one and this was one of her favorite gifts. Everynight she says 'fish' before bedtime. It has a timer so  she falls asleep watching it. Great 1st bday gift!!
"I foster cats, and dogs and they all have accidents and this is the only stuff that I found that actually gets out the urine smell  out of my carpet and the floor. When ever they make a mess. I recommend to everyone! A+"
Bottoms run small! Very cute suit but I won't be able to use the bottoms. They are tiny. I am 5'5&#34; 135 lbs size 8. The medium bottoms were way to small. I should be able to use the top however.
"The cleaner is very good but whoever makes the spray bottles needs to improve on the sprayer.  The trigger does not consistently return after squeezing it.  I have experienced this on a number of Martha's spray bottles.  Martha, are you listening?"
I tried them out for the first time today and when taking the clasp off and removing from my ear the post bent like I was the hulk. I’m not green nor am I very strong. Not worth the price for the swanky packaging. The actual product pretty crappy.
I have been wanting som earings like this forever. I found these for a such a good deal I was a little skeptical at what the quality would be like. But they are so nice and they look really good on I get so many compliments when I wear them.
Super soft and comfortable.  Slim fit but not too slim that I can't fit my hands in the side pockets.  Just the right amount of tightness at the ankles.  Just what I wanted.  Considering getting more of these.
"Listing says that it is compatible with YS524, however it does not fit. The attachment piece is the wrong size and has incorrect notches/grooves for that model shaver. Also note that the comb piece is not adjustable, it's fixed about 2-3mm"
"some of the charms colors are questionable and the painting on them is a little askew, other then that ive lost interest in animal jam so this sort of thing no longer interests me. but for anyone you know that is into this, its a decent gift to give."
I am really happy with my fitbit flex 2 band. It fits great and stays on well too. The packaging was also very nice and reusable for travel. Product was shipped to me right away so I got it in time for a trip.
"I am only going to state that there is only 2 stars, because the card was nice, but arrived LATE!! My Grandson did not receive it till AFTER his birthday and I had ordered it a week before!!! Won't order again."
"I love this bra. It looks so pretty.  I should have ordered a bigger size.  I like the cup size, apex, and underwire.  I don't like the wings.  I orderd a 42, next time I am going to order a 44."
These are okay once you finally figure out which size to buy. But the packaging is like trying to break into a safe. Won't cut with scissors. No easy way to get them open. I do own two of the toys but won't buy the refills again.
"I bought a XL but it was a bit small in the chest area, so I gave it to my friend and she got me a XXL so now I have one again and I love it.  Nice and warm and soft on the skin."
"It is a nice print not embroidery.  I recommend my friend. I hope you always win. Thank you. God bless you. If this was helpful for you, please check helpful. Below. May the rest of your life, be the best of your life.  OZ"
"Great replacement band! The band seems a tad stiffer than the original fitbit flex band, but maybe this one won't rip like the original one did.  I bought a white band and the only downside is that it does get dirty easily."
"This pen smells great, and it’s cute but the colors are not the same as the photo, the colors of mine are off white and blue, but the photo it’s pink and white which is why i even bought it, so I’m not really happy with it"
"if you're working on invitations and you don't want that bubble look on your paper when you're trying to glue something on top of another thing, go with this. It works great with paper, taping ribbon on invites, and even sealing envelopes."
"FUN, and i am sure it has great accuracy-meaning it shocked the heck out of my snooty, i mean sophisticated sis the one that never tells a LIE!. we all laughed so hard, i swear the whole room shook and the lights dimmed! What simple FUN!"
"At first I was a little hesitant when I opened my earrings. I was afraid I bought too small of a size but once I put them on, they were the perfect size. I am happy with this purchase and plan to buy more from this company."
"I purchased two sizes of this label...the 1"" and the 1-1/4"" diameters.  They both work very well. Very glad I found them.  They are the perfect size for what I need.  Will definitely be buying them again."
"Our dog doesn't even acknowledge it.  We were trying to get our dog to pee in our yard, as he likes to pee in our neighbor's yard. It is very unassuming in our yard, but didn't work for us."
"You get what you see with this. Some people reviewed that the instructions were hard to follow. I DID have to cipher through them but, the experiments themselves were great and my son had fun while learning. That's really all that matters."
"I really like this skirt. I expected a different fabric, but it was cotton.it fit really well but kind of thin material. I wrote skintoned leggings that came midthigh and it worked well. I think I'm going to order a darker color."
Are you losing your bedroom life because you husband can’t keep up with you add these little pills to the bedroom and you will be back to your younger life take them a 4 hours before your bedroom time and the rest will be history highly recommended
"came with a patch that wasn't shown in the picture, the shirt was a different color than what I ordered, as well as the strings, which were an almost neon green and looked horrible with the shirt. and it fit very weird. Not satisfied with this product at all."
"We were just expecting a cheap knock off pair of pajamas, but they were really nice.  They have a butt flap so kids can wear them and not have to remove a layer to go to the bathroom when it's cold."
"My dentist recommended this for rinsing after flossing and picking, and BEFORE brushing. My teeth do feel cleaner than with other mouth washes. It is not always stocked in drug stores or super markets. Amazon is competitively priced and convenient. I am sold"
"It is beautiful and simple with a classic design that allows for form and function at a great price point.  The color makes it versatile as well.  This would be a great gift.** If you like my review, please hit ""Helpful"" to motivate me to write more. **"
Great calendar that is easy to clean & perfect size to put on the side of my fridge. I use it for meal planning and the extra pad is where I place my grocery list. Great tool for families on the go
"Purchased this for my daughter's birthday.  Sturdily built, basic game, just like the one I played forty years ago.  Kids are still enjoying it.  Not much bad to say about this: attractive plastic modeling.  No electronics.  She plays it with her friends for hours."
Can works nicely. Fish do not eat any of the different types as quickly as they do other foods. Small worms/larvae are completely desiccated. Only way any varieties in tank eat them is to crush up and let them soak prior to feeding.
"This is a nice light bat for our 3 year old, but it's a bit too long for him.  Unfortunately though, he isn't into t-ball as much as his older brother so I don't think it'll get used much."
"The table cloth could have probably been a little wider and longer to meet my unique situation, but I can not dock it due to my own personal situation. The table cloth was packaged, and delivered in perfect condition. It was a great addition to our child's birthday party."
Love it. I got so many compliments when I wore this dress to work. People wanted to know where I got it. Also wore it to church one week with heels and a nice necklace. I have two colors but I plan to get more.
"i love this top.  it appears that it would hide my momma belly.  i ordered my size, medium, and the top was to small at the bottom.  i didn't bother trying on the bottoms so i don't know how they fit. i recommend ordering up."
This is a really nice facial cleaner the silicone fingers invigorate your skin feels really good and deep cleans your pores I use it with a grapefruit wash and have seen marked improvement in my skin It’s rechargeable so no batteries to buy
Purchased quite a few lanyards. I actually ened up returning these because the clips to attached your mask to the lanyard is bigger than expected. My child definitely felt the clips hanging & were super bulky. Found lanyards with smaller clips that worked better for us personally.
"I just started using this book last week. As an avid self-guided journal user, I think this is a great one. It keeps me on track with my exercise goals, and it helps focus my mind in the morning around a motivational quote from scripture."
The lines on the shirt make it so that it looks like you are wearing it crooked. Bought it just for 4th of July but I can’t even wear it. Nice material but the lines make it unwearable. Waste of money
Just couldn't get the zipper under control.  Hands a bit arthritic - which is why I wanted front closing bra in the first place - and I just couldn't get the zipper zipped.  So that told me to try something else.
"My picky dog will eat this, but he keeps pleading with me to give him something else. The ingredients are good. But because he doesn't like it I won't buy more. He grew up on Blue, so I will go back to another flavor."
"It has been several months since it arrived and I am happy with my purchase. Functional, smooth action and fits perfectly under my desk yet leaves plenty of room left and right for my legs and poodle, Preston, who keeps my feet warm while I work. I would recommend."
"I've only tried one and it works fine. I powered it with a 4.8v receiver battery and tested a large pile of used servos. Haven't tried it with an ESC and motor yet. I wasn't expecting much for the cheap cost, but am satisfied.."
"I purchased this specifically because of the size. It was annoying to put together and when it didn't fit where we wanted to put it, I measured it and saw that it's not actually the size that the listing advertises."
"This collar is for tags only. Since we switch between a leash and a harness, we wanted a collar that would always have his tags on in case he gets lost.  Easy to resize and the puppy grows, and looks very nice."
Beautiful calendar BUT.... the numbers are so small we can hardly see them and we aren't that old! Mid 40's so buyer beware if your vision isn't the best you may want to skip this one for a larger print.
"I have used these pens years ago, when they were easy to get and didn't cost a lot.I still have one from then that I keep in my Bible case.I picked up another one about a year or so ago.My daughter thinks I'm crazy for paying so much, oh well."
"These Strepcils are awesome, they have a nice flavor and are very soothing to the throat. I like to have a few boxes around all the time, especially in the winter when colds and flu are prevalent. (You can only eat so much chicken soup…)"
"Using these for a Going Bananas themed birthday party. I suspect the kids will use them for stop motion.overall very cute and will serve their purpose.  I feel they are way overpriced, but they seem to be a good quality"
I loved this sound machine! I needed an extra sound machine for my daughters room and love the different sounds it has for each mode. It’s loud enough to fill up the room and overall it feels sturdy and great quality!
I just love these shoes I bought the khaki pair and it goes with so many outfits I get stopped and get compliments all the time I just now bought another pair for my daughter and she receive them today and she loves them
"I find this to be very comfortable for my wrists, wondering how I did without a wrist pad now! My only complaint is that it gets hot against my skin and makes my palms sweaty. Thinking I need a cooler one."
"This is probably not politically correct in every office situation. In fact, you could probably be &#34;written up&#34; for indiscrimate usage... however, the sound effects, the voice and the different sayings make this a good piece for &#34;illustrating&#34; your awareness that some piece of information might be lacking in substance...."
"Seems sturdy and comfy. Box came with two allen hex keys to tighten screws, One was not needed and not on instructions, almost stripped some screws because was using the wrong one which doesn't even belong to this product. Small issue."
"I like the glasses themselves. Decent material and the lenses are lightly blue tented...however, they failed all of the tests I found online to see if they are truly filtering blue light. If you're getting them just for fashion, have at it. But they don't actually work."
If you have a larger head this hat may be a little tight.  For standardized head to hat sizes it's a tight fit so it won't blow away in the wind.  Hoping it will stay on at the beach without having to use the straps.
"Bought this after hearing that elevated food bowls might stop cats from throwing up after eating. Our cat usually threw up 2 to 3 times a week but since getting this bowl, now at about 2 weeks, there have been no incidents up the cat throwing up. Seems to work."
"I think my cat can read the ""do not step on this"" sign when i stick this on any surface. He stopped climbing on the kitchen window ever since, he is forbidden there to avoid fur spreading around the food area, it worked well"
"Had not received forms ordered from IRS, and these came exactly as they said, the day before the deadline. Very nice quality with plenty of extra forms and envelopes, except for 1096s, only contained three, which was adequate, but a couple more would have been handy. Terrific service!"
I have a 12lb maltipoo. I just needed to fold it and adjust it according to her neck circumference. I did wash them before I used them coz they smell like factory chemicals. I hand washed them and dried them off on my bath tub.
"I took my cat in this carrier on a round trip to South America by Avianca. Good size for a 10 pd cat. He could lied down, turn and he felt comfortable in this carrier. Is sturdy and is not heavy. My cat felt protected hiding in this bag."
"What a fun little gift and a nostalgic way to remind me of my childhood.  I bought this for a friend's son and he thoroughly enjoyed it.  The smell of the markers were spot on to their description - banana, green apple, etc."
Although I have no idea how it tastes this is the only dry food my cat likes.  I change up the flavor every now and then but he always eats it.  I will stick with it as long as he's happy.
"Came with so many things like a birthday banner, some balloons (I’ didn’t use all the colors), stickers (so many!) cupcake toppers and a cake topper! I did get a different balloon arch because I wanted purple but it was fantastic!"
I like the shirts but they are a size too small for me. I wear a XL and certainly needed a XXL in these shirts. They were light and seemed well made. I will be sending these back and purchasing the next size larger.
I'm giving 3 stars for prompt delivery & great price but the item arrived in a damaged box. I wanted to give this as a birthday gift for one of my 8 year pld daughters friends but I don't feel comfortable giving it looking this damaged so that's disappointing.
"I was nervous about buying a product without a review...I also saw tons of negative reviews for mobile whiteboards in this price point. However, this is fantastic. Great quality with sturdy assembly. Easy to put together in less than 20 minutes Could not be happier."
We have been playing many different versions of Carcassonne for the past 12 years...the original and many of the stand-alone versions.  This is one of our favorite stand-alone Carcassonne games.  Our 8-year-old daughter really likes playing it with us!
"So far it has worked just fine. I can slide it onto my waistband, pocket,  purse, etc., and know that it's not going slip off. It's definitely a tight fit, but you can loosen it up if necessary just by prying it apart a bit..but not too much!"
"Bought these to use as tree branches, spray painted the white to brown and used small leaves to create a true tree effect. Comfortable and stayed on my head all night. The branches are a little wide so just watch it when you walk through a door way."
"The first bottle arrived with the seal opened, and liquid spilled all over. Had it returned and received a replacement bottle couple days later. However the replacement bottle also has a hole in the seal. Either the quality check is poor or someone is going around tampering with the product."
"Probably the cheapest sister of battle you'll ever buy - but certainly doesn't look like it. I love the option to buy an unpainted model as well - the painted one is great, have mine on boxed display - love the vibes."
"I bought these as a gag gift for my boyfriend. He likes the pattern, and the color hasn't faded over the past eight months... He doesn't wear them often because &#34;there's just not much support.&#34; I didn't realize this was an actual problem, but hey."
"The material is somewhat silky feeling. The chest area fits nice but is a bit snug around my belly.  I am XXL, so yes a larger belly area.  Just waiting to loose some belly fat to be able to actually wear this one with confidence."
These were an awesome covering for my mini drone! I was concerned about all the dust I was landing around but now it worries me less because of these protectors. They fit no problem under my propellers and were snug and tight against the propellers without hindering their movements.
"Terrible listing!  Wish I’d read the reviews to indicate they were unpainted. They are dark brown and cheap plastic. It wouldn’t be possible to paint them to look like the photo. Don’t waste your time or money. Even as cheap as they are, I’m not keeping them."
These invitations are adorable!  I love how they look like a little train ticket and the bright red envelope with provided Thomas #1 stickers were a perfect fit for my son's Thomas themed birthday party.  I recommend them!
I wish it had A sturdier backing. The backing is just a thin layer of foam so when it arrives it was rolled up in the package it kind of stays that way. Either it needs a sturdier back or they need to ship it flat.
Nutritionally this may be great but I couldn’t get past the smell. My shepherds get tripe every night which is enough to gag a maggot and I have no problem with that but this powder just didn’t seem right. Rudy ate it but not enthusiastically.
"I’ve been using CBD oil from my local marijuana shop, but due to issues in our city, I moved to the Internet. I’m not sure about the quality of this oil (or the color), but I’m giving it to my dog and hoping it’s not a hoax."
I bought this for my son who is into katanas. One of his favorite colors is purple so this was a great gift.  He loved it.  I have to say it is quite impressive looking.  Very cool!
"Look I'll be honest with you, I just bought these for pajamas. I would never wear these in public. I don't want the world to see my fat butt in booty shorts. But for pajamas, they're great and exactly what I needed."
Product is amazing! I wish it was quadruple the size! I have a Russian Tortoise and must have misread the dimensions. So I had to return 😞 Wish I could have kept! Will buy again if I get a smaller turtle!
"It’s cute, but the back pushes down to tighten with a clasp. My puppy has long hair so it pinches her hair into it. It also came with a small yellow mark on the bow which is annoying considering this is supposed to be new. Looks like paint almost."
"Much nicer and heavier duty aluminum without much of a weight difference compared to my 4 year old aluminum front and rear arms.  The E Clips are very thin and brittle, I used some stainless steel ones instead of the provided ones after the first clip broke."
I bought these for my husband and I to use at a Monster Jam event we were going to. The sizes fit our ears perfectly. They were not uncomfortable to wear either. Once they were in they stayed in place.
"I'm very sensitive to certain scents and chemicals in soaps. I also have a problem with dry skin, especially around my elbows, this soap does a fantastic job of cleaning and it helps alleviate some of the dry itchy skin problems around my elbows."
"These were the right size for my needs but they are not perforated so are hard to remove from the book. Maybe I just thought all such items would be perforated and didn't just read the fine print, but I'll have to buy another brand next time."
This product is amazing!  My cat loves closed spaces. She’s a big kitty too. It’s thick and durable and cute as heck. Would definitely fit a small dog -up to 10 lbs. I don’t think a pug would fit but a Pom or chihuahua would.
"This little guy really is a super cute toy. The sounds it makes are cute and it easilyGoes to sleep mode. I must admit, I was disappointed that he doesn’t actually walk. There is a wheel on his stomach that rolls him. I probably should have read the details better."
"I bought 2 of these in different sizes and they both worked above expectations.  The trim ring tightened down tight against my ceramic tile shower (used a hammer drill for the holes),  and the finish matched my ORB shower fixtures.Love it!  Bongo Bob"
My kid LOOOOOVES this!! Dives head first in sometimes (which isn’t the best life decision) but great product. Would recommend to buy more balls to give the full effect (which I think you have to buy separately but can’t recall) - I purchased during Christmas time last year.
not recommended at all it’s a bad quality I used it a few times for short time but it got color from my jeans (it’s a good brand CK jeans) otherwise it looks so cute and elegant but not with stain though!
"Because of the design, it doesn't wring out well.  Too  much water left in mop head which ends up on the floor when you put any pressure on the mop head.  Might be okay for tile, but not for wood!"
I purchased this doll to give to my adopted granddaughter. She will be in the family shortly so it is just waiting for her. It is very soft and just as cute as the picture. Hope she takes to it.
"This item was purchased for my little nephew Kairo. And from what I understand, he loves Marvel comic characters.  His Mom said everything was fine with delivery.  I'm excited to hear from him on Christmas to tell me how much he likes his new friend."
This dress runs a little small. My daughter loves it. I was disappointed with how it arrived.  Very wrinkle in plastic bag. Daughter was happy with it. It is a little tight on her. She said the gym will get it to be looser.
"A really good looking telephone.  Or maybe its because it doesnt look like a telephone!!  Only complaint is that I was sent a different color.  I ordered black, but got a beige color.  It has good range, and is relatively straight forward to program."
"My fiancé loves the sweater, but it came in the wrong color. I ordered a pink sweater and I got a grey sweater. It was to close to Christmas to return it, so I had to give her the grey one."
"I needed a bag for my shirts if I sold one, and these were PERFECT!! I love the colors and the fact they are BIODEGRADABLE was the kicker! Little bit spendier then some other plastic bags but like I said- BIODEGRADABLE!"
"This binder is sturdy, holds the amount of pages I need it to without any damage. I really like that it is easy to open and close the rings and that the rings are flat on one side so the pages lay evenly."
It does the job. I wish it was thicker. In need to clean it with Simple Green Urine cleaner once a week otherwise it starts to smell. I have two medium dogs and three pieces of the turf. It looks nice and no problems with shredding or tearing.
It’s gorgeous but it came unglued in the package. I was able to hot glue the broach to the feathers and it was good as new. I kept it because it was a small repair and was still worth every penny. Looks so fancy and expensive.
I received this product on and it worked well. The weighing area is larger than most other pocket jewelry scales. After about 1 month of use it quit working. It was never dropped or damaged in any way. I changed batteries but it still wouldnt come on.
"After receiving this item and 3 family members using the product it was discovered that even though they say they have hemp CBD and other items in them they are not listed on the label, and do not work!! Stay away!! Once again buyer beware!! Scammers!!"
"No more standing on chairs!  Attach to broom handle and reach and twist.  It is really that simple; my students could do it with ease.  I left the clips hanging all year and simply reached up to change the artwork, etc.  Every classroom should have this!"
"Product seems fine but it will not fit the item, despite measuring before I ordered, that I purchased it for. Cord and especially the clasps are too large/thick.  I will return it.  Shipping was timely, no problems otherwise."
Very easy to put together although I wouldnt  recommend doing it by yourself the chair is very comfy and soft alot of  cushion and it feels  and looks expensive I can tell its going to last for a very long time great quality
"I gave this card to someone who is getting older, crabbier, and hates to celebrate anything!  My husband!  And he laughed loud and hard when he opened this very funny card  Great quality, funny picture, great message.  Love it."
I’m sure my grandson’s gonna love the robe I got a tan but it looks small so I’m going to have to exchange it probably for a 12 my grandsons 10 and he’s tall and thin so I’m hoping to 12 will fit
"I had high hopes for this product. First of all, the instructions are wrong, the stickers that they put on the pieces didn’t match the illustrations and there were several pieces I didn’t even use cause the quality was trash."
My dog loves jumping in mudpiles and he gets my car seat wet and dirty! But this dog seat cover works very well and keeps my car clean. It's waterproof and good quality so I am sure it will last a long time. Highly recommend.
No gift box and no converter. Imho falsely advertised. This pen should come with a larger box and a converter as standard along with the blue ink. Obviously the seller is able to sell the converters on the side so they take them out.
"For the cost and saying it doesn't streaks, I will be not buy again. It's not any better than most glass cleaners. I used as good or better for less. It does leave streaks. I used a quality microfiber cloth too."
"I buy a Great Dane Calendar every year, criteria is the majority of the Danes do not have cropped ears.  This one has lots of great sweet photos.  It is a gift and I know recipient will love it."
"The squirrels ate most of it. They left the dried up corn though. Very large bag for the price. This is a value size for the price. I’m not a squirrel or bird so can’t say how it tastes, but they ate most of it."
The picture shows the top tin of 20g on top of the tin of 90g which is the size the apple scented putty was described as. The putty is great but less than 1/4 of what it should have been.
Decided to keep them...snug to pull up but comfortable one I have them on.rode in a car for 12 hours.. comfortable and not stretched out eat all. Gave them a 4 due difficulty getting them over my thighs and hips
This product arrived on time and in excellent condition. It will make a wonderful gift for my daughter who grew up watching these characters on t.v. I know she will be greatly pleased with this product. I would recommend this company to anyone.
Was a little concerned about the negative reviews but ordered George anyways.  Glad I did.  He's perfect.  Very happy with my purchase.  He is just a little smaller than the talking which is perfect because he is the little brother.  Adorable and very soft.
I did end up using every single one of these for our family Christmas cards but was not overly impressed with the quality. The print was a little cheap looking. They did adhere well to the envelopes but I will be more careful on my selection next year.
"These are definitely not the same quality as the leading L brand and neither is the manual for building it. Instructions were difficult to follow, but we managed to figure it out. My daughter (9) has had fun playing with this and the bricks are compatible with the leading brand."
"These are super cute, but...the first time I ordered them, I received 4 pairs of a different style. This time, I received 4 pairs of the right ones. I thought I was only ordering one. Am I missing something here?"
"This envelope is just the right size to enclose with a fund raising letter.  Most personal checks or money orders fit perfectly.  We use a self-addressed Monarch envelope as a convenient way to send a donation, but it could also be used for payments."
This works better then expected at keeping yhe dog hair and the dirt in one place. Easy  to vacuum and clean.  Stay in place and helps keep my pet from sliding  all over the backseat  and protect my leather from there nails.
I like how this laugh and learn toy set comes with four different toys that look very realistic to the adult electronics. It also gives the child a variety of toys to play with. The toys in this set are also sturdy and durable.comes with batteries.
"I bought it to remove hot air from my car, and it does just that.  Not to the extreme of making the car cold, but it is cooler than the outside temp.  Perfect for what I need it for.  Thanks."
"Most awesome socks ever! The design, of course, is fabulous, but the fit is also great. The socks are made from a soft material, are cushion-y, go on easily, and also stay up. Highly recommend and will buy more of this brand (with different designs!)."
"I haven’t had it for that long but it looks like great quality, the only thing that could be better is if it had all the small slots in the front and a different section for the big ones in the back."
I really wanted to like these... but printing is off and not great. Packaging items came all wrinkled and crumpled... good thing I only needed a couple...the others where not functional. Bummed... really not worth the price on these... had better luck with others.
The material is thick and very comfortable. I am a 34C size 6 (7 juniors) pants 5'7'' and I ordered a size 8 and it was a little tight for my taste so I ordered another one size 10 and it was perfect. I received a lot of compliments.
The arms are a little long because it's got thumb holes at the end of the sleeves. Since I'm pretty tall this means the sleeves are actually long enough for me. One of my favorite hoodies to wear right now
"It is Legos, and you get what you pay for.  My son is 11 and had a blast building this.  Of course it is well designed and excellent instructions - you just expect that as the norm from Legos.  Buy it and enjoy.Dana"
"Works well for the smaller kraft cotton filled  2-1/8 x 1-1/2  small boxes and the rectangle medium cotton filled 3.5 x 2.5 boxes. Any larger than this would be very tight, possibly snap. Feels similar to cloth hair ties, very stretchy, but strong. I will purchase again."
"I got a medium and I should've gotten a small. 50/50 chance, I'd get it right. But worked with it, and was able to adjust it to fit me, not sewing/altering, just moving clasps around and tightening around the back. It worked out well"
"These shoes are so pretty, well made and look great on my daughter's feet.  The shoe seems to run true to size, but if you have a narrow foot, they might be a little wide.  I would recommend them for sure..."
"It's soft and comfortable for my dog, non-restrictive, soft. Easily adjustable. Has plenty of adjustment room to fit her perfectly. Has good color options and MUCH better than others of lesser quality that I've seen in store for twice the cost. Wil definitely purchase another for my other dog."
"It says 14 inches, but it's small like a dog toy.You really can hug or sleep with it.It's really soft but I thought it would be closer to Build A Bear size.I collect plushies and this one I'm giving to my fur babies."
"My dogs refuse to play with this ball & they love playing with balls.  The one time I could get one of my dogs to pick it up, she spit it out and kept sticking her tongue out, like the ball had a bad taste..."
We give these out to the little ones who come to our door trick or treating. It's something different and they really like receiving these! When they yell to their parents that they got  play-doh then you know you did good!
"Love the BPA Free Premium Cat Litter Mat!  Wish I had ordered one years ago.  Kitty jumps out of her litter box onto the mat, and mat attracts all kitty litter from her paws.  Vacuums up easily.  Great product!"
"my son played with this twice. The carver randomly shuts off, and it doesn't carve anything as neatly as they show in the commercial. The mess to clean up after is another reason I don't like it. Don't waste your money"
"I actually bought this to attach to my shirt for a superhero race -- I'm 5'3&#34; and, spread out, the covered me from mid-shoulder to mid-shoulder, and almost to my lower back. Great quality, though I don't know about the Velcro attachments since I didn't used them."
"I have Morton’s Neuroma and so I need soft cushioning helps me in losing my limp or need for shoeless time, but this is so thick that it sqeezes my foot and the plastic padding that my sore spot actually gets worse and I need to trt a new option."
Normally i get a size 12 to 14 dress... got this in a 3x and it fits perfectly!!! And i get many compliments when i wear it!!! Need your business cards to hane out to people who have asked me where to get one
The one on right is what I wanted but I was delivered the one on left and one pen was broken in the pack and all the pens arrived in a clear cover rather than the package in the picture.
"The only complaint i have with this box is that there needs to be a hinged bottom in it. My bird has a grate and she can I can not use it in her cage. I can spread the pieces on the floor or my bed, which does work!"
"This handbag is very well made, simple and lovely. It has outside slip pockets to hold my keys and phone, as well as inside zipper pocket and storage pockets.  Very important and efficient combination. It will be very serviceable and enjoyable to use for years."
"Absolutely beautiful and a perfect size for a woman. They are made a little cheap though. The shell part actually popped out of the silver backing, but luckily we caught it. We just had to glue it back in, but it was disappointing to have that happen."
I really like this ! In order for this to work u must workout with it not just wearing it and not doing any work outsI did the Chloe Ting workout with it and I was dripping in sweatDoes run small
Loved the beach  colors and print. Its just a fun thing to put on the dog for summer walks. Bought both the matching leash and collar.The clasps and fasteners are sturdy and work flawlessly. No problems with this purchase.
"I really love the skort I purchased. It gives me freedom to work in the yard, go fishing or just chilling out.  Knowing that regardless of what I do, I am still covered in all the right places is a really great feeling."
Recently started perming my eyelashes and this tool is a MUST for that. The precision tip lets you get in and manipulate every single last lash. Throw in a 3x magnifying mirror and you are perming your own lashes baby. Worth the money if you’re a do-it-yourself kind of gal!
This pants are not waterproof as they claim. It does not stand even in the slight drizzle. The sweatpants I was wearing underneath got water all over it. I was going to return it but unfortunately I lost it in the campsite.
"The calendar information met my expectations, but Amazon blew it in shipping. The backing which holds the calendar paper together (so it can be torn off daily) had two cracks in it; i.e. the calendar was in 3 pieces. Very disappointed in ereceiving damaged merchandise because of poor Amazon packing/shipping."
"This does not fit the WRGBII PRO.  It says on the box ""For WRGBII"".  it will attach to the WRGBII Pro but will fall off at slightest touch, and hangs at an angle that is worthless and doesn't shade anything."
"This definitely cleaned my dog's teeth. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, because she's a bigger dog and had no trouble ripping a piece off. So, just keep an eye on your dog, while they're using this, especially if they still like to just chew on things."
i’m 6 foot and i’ve been dealing with a lot of back pain because of posture and my neck leans forward. i’ve been using this for the last couple of days since i got it and i’ve had no more back pain or neck pain!
This has never happened in the many years we have been ordering live food for our critters but there were huge holes in the box. We had worms in our mailbox and now have a mail carrier who has PTSD!
This was exactly the item that we needed.  We use it for displays here at the library and it is of good quality and crystal clear.  We appreciate quality items at good prices.  Thank you for prompt delivery also.
"This product does what it says.  I just sprinkle a different dog food for my Mastiff, and she spends a good 30 minutes looking for the kibble.The Mat is sturdy enough and I think will hold up on a washer, I haven't ran they the wash yet."
I like this product.  plenty of room for mom and babies after they are born.  then plenty of room for babies to grow after removing mom. Suction cups not as strong as needed.  cage fell to bottom over night leaving babies vulnerable.
This is definitely not like the one I order the only thing that is the same is the buttons. It is cheaply made. I really wanted to buy this Becuase I loved the desgin of the color and flowers and this is definitely not it beware
I bought as a Christmas gift for my 8 year old daughter who seen it and wanted this exact plush in a store recently. I hopped on Amazon and found it for a third of the cost! It’s a great size and it’s super soft. Well made.
Order arrived on time. Very pretty and shiny.  The color is gold but It is not a yellow gold.  Very detailed.  Light weight but sturdy. They will look good on a charm bracelet.  Will order again.
"This fit me ""just right"".  It is made with very light material, and hardly takes up space in a drawer or closet.  I am looking forward to wearing it to my sons school Halloween party....Moo, ha, ha, ha!!!!!"
"I purchased these to put my ACNH Amiibo cards in. They have been very durable, no issues with tearing or anything. The cards haven’t stuck to the insides, colors haven’t transferred. I’ve had issues like that with other sleeves, but these are great. I’d recommend these to anyone needing some."
"My cat LOVES this toy,  It's her favorite.  Would be nice to have another similar toy with all of the same features, only on a short stick.  (she likes to play fetch with it too, and the long stick doesn't fly far enough.)"
This blood pressure monitor seems to be accurate comparing it to Drs reading of my blood pressure. I like it much better than the arm cuff monitor. Since I’m having to check my blood pressure daily the wrist cuff monitor makes it quick & easy.
"Very nice. the only downfall  is you can not put them on more than one page. Love the sayings on them. I use them for everything it seems like. They do very well in my appointment book, and cake yearbooks, even notebooks, oh and of course books."
"Very sturdy, high quality leash.  Looks great too.  Like the shorter length for walks in town where more control is needed.  Handle is comfy to hold.  If the carabiner had a swivel base (my dog twist and turns a lot), it'd be perfect."
"Thin consistency spreads easily over the entire dog and smells amazing! It's a great shampoo and I'd highly recommend it for you pup over any other dog shampoo. As a dog owner for 25 years, I can say that this is by far the best shampoo for your pup!"
"I've been taking it for a few weeks now. I don't see or feel any difference yet.  I will continue to take it until the bottle is empty, hopefully by that time I would feel the benefits of it."
"This mat is perfect for hardwood/laminate floors.  Stays where you want it to.  I did find it a little pricey but since it works well and will protect my floor, I guess it is worth it (time will tell, I've only had it for a week)."
"I bought a Rhinotek cartridge and virtually no ink came out when I installed it.  I took it out and reinstalled it, and also did the cartridge cleaning procedure: no effect.  So I had to rush out and buy an HP cartridge."
I have been looking for this game forever. I used to play it when I was a kid. Would have given a higher rating but it only had two colors of stones to play with and its a 4 player game usually.
Great socks. Warm but thin so dress shoes can still be worn. Wonderful invention. I would have loved warm knee socks when I was walking a long way to high school in the cold and snow. 50 years too late but great for freezing days on theatre days in Chicago.
I bought a small though my dog is 22&#34; high and weighs 33 lbs. it's too big to properly fit. I will have to take it to a shoe repair shop to make it smaller so that it doesn't choke him.
I love this because I was trying to stop doing things on my phone and have something in my purse. I can look at each week and double any time I need too. It is not too big and where I can carry it.
"I like not having to pull out the card when I dine out. Using cash or a gift card saves my credit for necessary things. Of course, if you can write it off, avoid the gift card.Unfortunately this restaurant doesn't have take out like most Chinese places. Very ""fusion"" food."
This is an outdoor toy for our 5 year old and 1.5 year old. It's huge so it's perfect for removing our nicely laid mulch and moving it around to other areas of the yard where it doesn't go. It's perfect for outdoor entertainment.
I bought this for my teenage daughter as she needed this style white for participating debate team and science fair. The fit was nice and the price was excellent. Cotton fabric was nice and looks like it will wear well.
The lens on the right side works well enough.  The lens on the left side is out of focus at all distances.  Since I read with my left eye the glasses have very little value to me.  David Edwards
Purchased a few different pearl kits for my niece and nephew and they loved them. They were so excited about opening up the shell to see which pearl they would get. It was a fun little project to keep the kids busy.
These pens offer a very bold and professional feel. They handle well and they give an excellent grip. The ink is very smooth and black. I like different types of pens but just discovered these types of rollerball pens recently. I love the elegant appearance.
"They are fine. I did not purchase them for paraffin wax liners, but instead as a hygiene use for my feet. My attempted solution for my issue did not work (it resulted in athlete's foot), so I don't suggest sleeping with these on."
"This button arrived with the pin part broken off. It was a tiny, cheap, pin that must have been barely glued to the back. Very disappointed that I paid $8 for a pin and it is so cheap! Better quality at the dollar store."
"Not nearly as nice or as solid as it looks in the photo. Very flimsy, thin urathane. Not great quality. Also not a youth! Fits me (full size adult) fine. Enormous on my 4 year old son. Looks ok on. Would work in a pinch for a quick Halloween costume."
"I like it, I just wish it had some pages for notes. I like to write a lot of notes during the year. The sticky notes included are cute like doctor, meeting etc Just need some blank pages for notes."
"The lens are distorted , looking straight on they are fine but when moving about they distort my vision , like looking into a mirror that's bent causing the distortion.  Also you can't return them for a refund.  Must of missed that fine print!"
Pangea is a wonderful company and this very simplistic and sturdy product just reiterates that. The ledge is easy to clean and the magnets hold very well. The price point is better than any other similar product. It also comes with plastic cups which is great.
"I am very pleased with my purchase of this item. I have made many many prints and still using the cartridge. I just could not make myself pay what they were selling for at Office Depot, Target, and Walmart. I will purchase this product again."
"[[VIDEOID:3d21706603b26ef83e32666083743a0c]] I intended to use for watercolor, but it’s larger than I expected and there is no flex/bounce back to the bristles.  Also a pretty uneven tip.  Not the fault of the product, but more the lack of details in the description.Handle feels like cheap plastic."
Very cute planner and very much worth the cost.  I got this as a replacement to my normal much more expensive planner because I was tired of crossing things out for the rest of 2020.  It has done me well.  Love the pattern !
"This is a really good case. If my boyfriend drops his dexcom, it is well protected.  The only flaw that I see is that if I want to charge the dexcom I have to take it out the sleeve because the leather is in the way."
"We have cats, and my son likes Star Wars, so this is a nice combo. I wish the photos were smaller so that the actual calendar part was larger to give more room to write things on each day. But it still gets 5 stars for being cute and fun."
I was surprised when I received this product which looks like it's for a child. This just seems like a 99 cent toy. Ive had several massages and I thought this would be great for the body upkeep it just didnt work out.
"Strong, sturdy hole-punch.  Flip the metal tab, and you can see exactly where you need to punch.  I put a small ""x"" on my unshrunk, shrinky dinks to line up the viewer perfectly.  It is well made and should last a long time."
"This was the second time I bought this item because I liked the visors that you could pull out to the side.  However, it is poorly made and I returned this one as well.  Will not purchase this item again."
"This item does not do anything advertised. I have tried it on all frequencies and it has absolutely no effect on the dog whatsoever. It sits literally 10 feet from the dog when it does it's barking and nothing, nothing at all. So incredibly disappointed."
It is in great quality. Both the cover and paper feels good. Some stickers inside are really cute. I was supposed to send this as a gift but I decided to keep it because I love it so much when I see it at first glance.
The item is not as pictured! It does not have a reusable lid. It is only a shallow clear plastic tray with plastic wrap. Not fresh. Not packaged from manufacturer. Would not trust to give this to my dogs. Does not offer returns! Absolutely shameful Amazon!
"Fits perfectly in the rear seat of a 2020 GMC Acadia. Flaps on the sides zips up to protect door handles. Or hangs down to let the pups look out. Installs in minutes, we just toss their favorite blankets in and they are confined to the back seat but content."
"These are great for the price, though I was a bit disappointed that the color is only on one side. That could be my own neglect of the description, though. They work for what I needed, but keep in mind that they are not thicker than regular paper."
"I really like this planner! I like that it has enough space to write my daily things to do and that even in the calendar portion, there's enough space for me to write people's birthdays and appointments.Writing in this planner makes me feel like I have my life together lol"
"Great gift, but the item sticker put right on the front is disappointing. I bought as a gift and it just looks tacky with the sticker haphazardly stuck on the front for no reason. I tried peeling off and it kept breaking so now it’s even worse"
I have had these for about a month and finally used one with my Dreamwear nasal mask.  It fits perfect and is very comfortable.  Why pay for the OEM when these work just as well  and you can have straps that aren't worn so bad?
My mother is 82 and has arthritis in her hands. She likes to can fruit in the summer and putting the rings on the jars was becoming increasingly painful.  This jar opener helps her tighten the rings. She loves it.
Have been using this ball point pen for some time and love the easy writing experience it provides. Cheap yet dependable - you can't go wrong. One caveat was the grip was different from the picture - maybe an older version. That's why one star was knocked off.
I wanted to love the oil but it's not very strong. I bought this and breath easy and both don't really do much for a scent at all. There's no dropper so you have to figure a way to measure your drops. I won't buy again.
Good set for it's price. A few items that I never used before that actually came in handy once I YouTube'd how to use them properly (didn't need any unnecessary accidents lol). Love the case. Would def recommend esp. as a gift!
"San Marcos, TX is the mermaid capital of Texas. On 9/25 there was a big parade downtown and our community had a float in that parade. The 12 mermaids were a big hit. I will probably order more for next year's parade."
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for someone and the item arrived damaged. Not giftable. The outside plastic covering was scratched and dirty. When I opened it, the paper inside looked like it had been moist and had black dirt on it."
"I bought is fr my niece for her first Christmas. Her room the,e is zebra sort was perfect. She loves to ride it now that she is bigger. It makes generic horse sounds and it is great quality materials. I love it."
I like the compact size as I don't have a lot of space on my desk for a full size printer. I use it for printing out reports for my business and some internet information.The print quality is good. Easy setup. Very happy with this order.
I buy this every year and I don't even live in Austin but I love to visit. This calinder tells you what is going on all year long so you know when the best time to visit is........for me that's EVERY WEEKEND!! I love Austin:)
Bought these for my wife (school teacher) they are very handy or useful. There was another product with more staple removers but it was out of stock. Chinese products went up in value and others that offered more for your money went out of stock.
"I just got these but so far I love them!  They are sooooo cute!!  If you like bling, these are for you!  They write good too.  Would make wonderful gifts for that flashy girl who has everything!!"
It does taste like strawberries but I have started adding a few frozen strawberries to shake mix and got much better results. It is handy when I don't have access to frozen fruit when on the go so I still use it sometimes.
"I can’t tell you how it tastes, well.. because I am not a dog but I can say that my doggy loves it! It is a little hard so I’d definitely recommend smashing it up a little before serving. But other then that no complaints!"
"Definitely fits large.  I wear 9 1/2 - 10 and ordered a 9, which still had a little room.  Sandals are awesome - wore them to the beach and for waverunners.  Very comfortable and hold up so well."
"We have a 9 ur and 4 ur old yorkies and when they aren't on the couch they are lying on the heating pads! Much safer than ising the human pads!! The timer on it os one of the best things, that I hadn't even thought of!"
"I purchase for my cleaning business. Every time you use it, you need to shake off the dust, if not it will leave the dust behind. When you wash, it will become matted after awhile. You can only use the top half. I do not recommend this product."
These are just barely usable.  They expand to go around your head but don't lock at all in this position.  They constantly want to retract and come off my ears.  This is a pain.  These are better than nothing but not great.  AVOID.
Awesome Bulma figure from Dragon Ball.Great proportion and body figure. One thing to note there is a crease on her right elbow. The rare color variation has the same crease so I could have just received an unlucky batch. But I still like this figure.
I bought this twice and both times the material that makes up the puzzles as well as the paint on them were chipped and flaking. This was despite being sent in two boxes and a puzze holder. Had to retur because i domt want it im baby's mouth
"I changed the batteries, but the pen just does not work properly.  Even when it was working, you had to touch the dot perfectly to get it to light up green.  Very confusing for a small child!  Plus, the cards are boring to look at."
Bought this for my little cousin and he absolutely loved them. The quality was good because it was super soft so i wasnt worried about him hurting anyone or himself. Pick this up if you have someone that is a hulk fan they will love them.
"Awesome toy, The Bruder line of toys are tough. Them hold up to all the abuse my boys can dish out, they look and work just like the real thing. I will continue to buy my boys Bruder toys for many years."
I order this product as discribed and as seen on my order as &#34;2&#34; COUNT.  However when I got my package there was only &#34;1&#34;  COUNT.WHAT??????????  False advertisement?????  I'd like my other pair of nippers. Immediately!
I love this product!! I've been using it on my maltese since the day I got him at 15 weeks.  It makes his fur super soft and he smells amazingggggggg.  I love the pear smell it is not too strong yet really pleasant.
This is a great dress!!!I typically wear an XL but after reading the reviews I decided to get a XXL. I would recommend everyone to buy their dress 1 size bigger than what they typically wear. Fits perfectly!!! Material is good quality. Can't wait to buy more outfits ❤
My bird just loves tearing these up. I get one every couple months and he enjoys every single part that comes in the basket and has even enjoyed ripping that up too. Hours and hours of pleasure for him. :)
There are many pieces that do not lie flat to attach. We have had to swap pieces w/ legos in our Lego stash just to be able to build this. It was not buildable using only the pieces that came with it. Instructions are also terrible.
"I purchased this as one of the collective Christmas presents for my grandchildren to share. They absolutely love it and tend to make up their owns games with it. Being that there are two shooting mechanisms, sharing is no problem. So far it lasting and working just fine."
"These probiotics are easy to swallow with no aftertaste. They have decreased my tummy troubles so I am happy with them. They haven't caused tummy ache gas or bloating (as some others have).They make me feel healthier, which is exactly what they are meant to do."
"These are great sunglasses! I love this retro look, and they fit my face very nicely. They block the sun great, and do not have a glare or distort anything while looking through them. They are my go to glasses now."
"While it's good for the price and the package arrived promptly (Amazon Prime), the quality of the skirt didn't satisfy me. It was really thin and easily wrinkled and the knot didn't seem as natural as shown in the photo."
"I discovered bamboo toothpicks and will continue using them, as opposed to the birch toothpicks I've used all my life. The bamboo lasts considerably longer, and since I like to chew on them, these provide extra time to do that. They really have sharp points, so be careful, though"
[[VIDEOID:b8839fbb6ad1ab273016f2fd60a6d092]] Got this for a friends dog.  Little dog really liked it a lot.It’s a very hard plastic so I think it’ll be good for very aggressive chewers.  I loved the colors too - they’re bright and stand out amongst other toys
"This band was a perfect match for the Gear S2, relatively easy to attach to the watch. I've had and worn it almost daily for now 3 months and no discoloration. It doesn't pinch my arm, the clasps holds tightly in place. A good purchase."
"I have been thinking about switching to organic underwear for a while. Happy to find choices of styles on hesta. The cotton is wonderfully soft; the cut just as I wanted, nicely below the navel. No more synthetic fibers for me."
"I loved the look, but I ordered this once and it was too small and I ordered two sizes bigger and it still fix the small. The look at great but they are all the same size it appears to me."
My printer hasn't worked since I've but the new ink in. The box was damage when I received it I should have returned it but I thought it would be okay. I believe the ink is dried out. Waste of my money.
"This is a really nice shirt! I’m 5’7 and 135lbs, I normally wear a medium but from reading other reviews I ordered an xl. It’s a little loose but will work perfect as a light jacket. Soft lining on body and sleeves, really good quality."
No description except the title. These are NOT Atocha Pirate Coins. They are mass produced poor quality metal coins from somewhere but not the Atocha. At $35 it is not worth returning for a refund. Just make note of this seller.
Good support and fits well. With all underwire sports bras I still use a stretchy/elastic one on top of it.  With size C breasts one bra is never enough. One for support and a second to flatten a little for aerobic work.
"Works great. It does not move as long as you dont overfill tub based on directions. Also our baby is 7 months 17 lbs so she ways it down well. No issues with drying, drys in bathroom in a day as long as you hang it up as directed."
I bought these for a small dog and we supervise when in use (unlike other dog toys that are available all the time).  They are a great value for the coat and have provided fun for our dog and us.
"Love the color! But most of all, the bristles are perfect!!! They are the right amount of soft and firm to get the job done. The bristles have some give to them so it doesnt feel like you're scratching your skin off, but definitely feels strong enough to exfoliate."
Bought for my child as together-activity. Instructions aren’t clear. Reading here I saw you pull pin out then wave wand. Nothing appeared in jewel when finger pressed there. Inside 2 figures in plastic. They didn’t pop out. Save your money
"Love the way they write and the depth of color, but they ran out of ink so quickly (i.e., within 3 weeks). For as much as they cost, I expect the ink to last much longer because I'm not going to continue to re-buy these pens at this cost."
I was hesitant to buy cultured rock off the internet and not being able to see it before purchase.  These rocks were delivered quickly and were teeming with organisms.  Will definately buy again from the Salty Bottom Reef Co.
"My grandson (6) is crazy about transformers, this one is a bit more than he and his parents can manuever easily.  Looks really cool once they figured it out. I think it is more for an 8 yr old than a 6 yr old."
"This item was SUPER tiny, and the edges of the fake diamonds scratched my nose as  Iwas putting it in, my nose hole is higher than most and it was not curved enough for me to wea it. I really thought it was pretty though. had to return it."
"I wish that these would last longer. I have a tank, with 3 Guppies and 5 shrimp, and I have to rinse the filters about once a week to make them last the whole 4 weeks. Many times I have replaced them before the 1 months timeframe."
This calendar is very cheerful.  Plus it is also functional and shows all the relevant holidays.  I tried to buy a different calendar for 2014 but then I had to go back to this one because of the beautiful colours and cheerful layout.  I highly recommend it.
"These cute little stuffed unicorns were the perfect gift for my two year old niece!  They are adorable, soft, just the right size for her little hands, and since they're all different colors, she loved telling us the color of each one.  Perfect gift!"
"My daughter loves the clippers, but I don’t care for the lack of quality. Two drawbacks are it is hard to see your child’s nail as you clip & they don’t do a very clean or sharp clip. The quality of the clip is disappointing."
Amazon was out of the Ironman glasses I usually get so I got these since the style looks the same. The quality however is much worse. Cheaper feeling. One of the lens doesn't even sit properly in the frame.Not worth 20 bucks
This was the first time I have used core labels.  Worked great for the 30+ soccer videos distributed to the team.  Easy to create a catchy label to put in the center and not have to worry about positioning a large label over the whole CD.
"Bought for my wife,  she says: it fits perfectly, it's not in Asian sizes,  it's western sizes. Or American sizes. Very soft fabric, very feminine and beautiful.  Would recommend this dress to anyone. I wear this at home and when I go out."
"This is a complete set of decorations, everything you need. Comes with a lot for the price, our 5 year old boy loved it! Paired this with a cowboy boot piñata and it was so festive for a cowboy theme party."
Good product but based on photos I thought it would be smaller. I decided its to loose for the square sticky notes I have at work but I can still use. It would be more of a hassle to return.
These are my favorite pants even however I caution eveyone. I am a size 5 and have to have an extra large I started ordering these for work pants a year ago and discovered the larger the better and they hold up too!
"We ordered a 3 pack of these glasses.  The first pair lasted a week, the 2nd pair lasted two weeks, and the 3rd pair lasted 2 minutes.  The arms easily unscrew and either we can’t find the parts or we would need to buy a repair kit."
"[[VIDEOID:5541b04b105f451f267e78c86dd9bff7]] I am presently Tortoise sitting for a neighbor and he made a joke about a chipmunk riding around on Tonto the tortoise.  Well, his joke came true.  This cute chipmunk is just what was needed to make it real.  HC"
My daughter who is 22 lives these things lately. Boy sure what the big thing is but she was very happy. Can not find a lot of these in stores so when she got this for Xmas she was excited I found the ones she wanted
"Love. Got for 1year old. Little big for her now but will quickly grow into it. Easy to assemble, sturdy and can be moved from indoors to outside easily. Minus one star because had to trim a few sharp places where the plastic was molded."
"Great looking watch, good feel, but the clasp design is such that when you bend your hand / wrist towards your elbow it presses on the clasp and the watch opens.Big design flaw for an active guy / someone who drinks and loses their nice things"
"The kids love this, works well and shoots the jelly balls quite far.  The included balls explode on contact, so easily melt into the ground, so no real need for cleanup.  In all, a neat little toy that the kids will have a bunch of fun with."
Not happy with the purchase. In the photo it looks nice an poofy but in reality it's three very flimsy layers that don't do anything to hold up the (light) weight of my dress.Delivery was on time... so there's that at least.
I got these supports for my husband that struggles with plantar Faciitis.  We have to replace shoes and support systems every 3 months to maintain good posture for him.  These are comfortable fit right into his shoes and has helped him not have knee and back issues.
This attachment makes it even easier to put on stockings if you are handicapped or have limited mobility. It makes a good product even better. Don't have to struggle and bend to get stockings on. I can sit in a chair and do it safely and effortlessly.
"Red Robin, specifically Tim Drake, is one of my favourite DC characters. This statue is absolutely fantastic, and absolutely worth the price. The details are perfect, and I love the ability to change the face/head. He fits in wonderfully with the other DC statues that I have in my room!"
I have thin lashes and I'm trying to get them to stand out more. This tool is perfect to help me curl them. It's easy to use and it perfect to use before you apply your mascara.. I would purchase this again. Great buy
Air purifier this works great for taking pet smell out of the room you can hear it run at night my husband is a smoker and  this take that smoke smell out of my living room this works great in smell spaces highly recommend
"This drum lasted about 10 months for me from Jan to Nov.  The print quality was good while it lasted but 10 months, for a drum that should have lasted 25,000 prints.  It lasted about 1 and half toner cartridge of 8000 print capacity"
"This ramp was sleek looking and looked like it would really help my Red Ear Slider, the problem was, it was way too small.  The platform was barely big enough for my girl, and theres no way it would hold her weight.  I ended up returning it."
"This is a very nice toy for my son. It has decent quality. All parts are as described and fits together pretty well. The best part is, it can pull my boy away from his iPad and spend a couple hours in the backyard! Awesome!"
"This ring is awesome. I got the gold and the silver. The silver was true to size, but the gold was about a size smaller than was marked on the ring. I liked this ring so much that I'm going to order another gold one a size larger."
"The material feels like costume material. I used it for a Halloween costume so that was fine for me, but as a regular top I wouldn’t recommend it. It was a little on the larger side for me but was comfortable."
"This tape is thick. It stays put on the roller, and does not fold back on itself. The cutter is sharp, and cuts the tape without excessive effort or shredding. Therefore, I have bought it several times. I won’t buy any other packaging tape."
"So far, so good. No complaints.  It had great reviews and so I ordered it.  I like the color, the size, and it's quick to read.  Not much else to say about a scale. Good price too. Will update this review if anything requires it."
"I like the idea of this, but it totally didn't work. It didn't make any difference if I had on mascara or not or how high it was set, it just didn't work. Then, after a few tries, it stopped turning on."
"Mom is legally blind and needs to have an address book listing her friends and family in one place.  This is the perfect book to have a listing with plenty of places to write names, addresses and telephone numbers."
Dog loves it. Doesn’t lick it off. With just the first use my dogs pads have become a bit suptle. Unfortunately his paws are dried & cracked a bit so we will repeat the process a few times a day.
I have a longer torso and this barely covered the waist of my midrise pants. It is cut straight so there is no shape at the waist. Very flowy and could be pretty cute I would just prefer it a little longer with a feminine waist shape
This is super cute and such a nice length but it came scraped and looked kind of tarnished already. The middle was the main damage with a few specks here and there. It's really nice! But I wish it didn't come damage. I might return it.
"I was happy to purchase this advent calendar for my dog because the treats advertised are made from natural ingredients.  However, many of the treats are moldy and not able to be given to my dog.  I am disappointed with this product."
The elastic that goes around the ear is not well attached. Some were even  detatched in the package. I needed the masks so I glued the elastic to the mask with Elmers.  It holds the elastic in place nicely when given a day or so to cure.
Love these coffee napkins for my coffee bar. They are so cute and I love the saying. I've searched around stores for coffee napkins and can't find any. I was so happy to buy these on Amazon. I've ordered these a few times.
"Hands down the best pencil sharpener I've ever owned, even the cheapest of pencils come to a nice point and the operation is so smooth and simple that it doesn't feel like a chore to keep my lead sharp during long writing or drawing sessions."
"Once built this is a very fast model. it goes a long distance across the hardwood floors (about 50ft) and still slams with a satisfying thud on the end wall. A nice hour long build, and not too difficult for a first grader."
"If you buy this in pink/peach you will need a dress slip, you can see the color of your underwear. The length is nice and the fit is comfortable. However the dress had a smell that was strong like some horrible chemical."
"Love it! So adorable for the beach. The material is a little thin, but it’s a swimsuit cover up so I would expect it to be thin. Nice fabric true to size, and so pretty.  Lightweight, and gives you a great shape. Got lots of compliments."
"I don't know how this can be considered a shaver if it doesn't actually shave.  I knew I was getting low quality based on the price, but this is bad even still.  I don't know how it has such good reviews; please don't waste your time."
My coonhound loves it. He doesn't care much for the heat but loves the outdoors. Needless to say he can get a bit dirty from time to time. A cycle in the washer and the mats like brand new. Zeus (my dog) thanks you for his mat.
I purchased for stocking stuffers for my  kids dogs and mine. All complained it did not stick to tile or wood floors. Jingle fell out. And rope pulled off of ball. The Dogs were blk lab brown lab golden retriever and a small mix bread. So disappointed.
"I bought this because my dog has chronic pancreatitis and possibly IBD. He has not vomited since I’ve been using this product, but I’ve also made a couple of other small changes so i can’t give all of the credit to this product."
"I ordered this to put my gent's paperwork in order.  It comes with labels (more than you need in case you screw up) and so far, it appears to be a very sturdy organizer for about 20 papers per divided section.  Nice color, too."
the paint is amazing and little details on it surely sells itself. although it gives you various objects to wield and interchangeable hands it has very little to no articulation and it can basically only pose in the picture as is. might as well have made it as a statue.
This scanner works very nice!  I was actually able to scan a 36&#34; X 60&#34; film of a survey map to PDF and it turned out great! Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a economically priced scanner. You really get a lot of scanner for the price!
"I use these to protect my skin from blistering when working in the sun.  Works very well, arms actually feel cool when I use them.  I just don't like the tightness at the top where my arm is larger."
I will definitely write review after I have used them. These are for my daughters Birthday party on August 25th so I have not blown them up yet. My daughter is obsessed with Aliens so this is going to be a fun decoration.
"I wish I had looked closer at the picture, but this package has no blue or purple so it's not a complete rainbow. Paper itself is nice and bright and a good weight for paper. If you need a blue or purple, you will have to buy it separately."
"I'm not sure what this could be used for.  I've been using a large bathe towel for the same purpose for years and it is much better.  The  SBBB is too rough, too small, and too heavy to make it in the bathe world."
"This is a very professional poker set. Good quality chips that feel and look professional. It comes with metal case with keys to lock it. It has really nice buttons for dealer, big blind, and small blind. Overall a great value set ."
"My Baby Bird loves these shelters and I have been buying them for her for many years.  This one is a bit larger than the previous one and it made her nervous at first.  She's fine now, though!"
"I got this for a casual house/backyard dress so no one, except a neighbor, will really see me in it. It's cute, and light which is what I wanted. It does run a little small. If you're a size 14 with a bust maybe go for xxl."
Lead is off-center which makes sharpening frustrating and lead breaks very easily.  I want to give students a pencil that is new but if I pre-sharpen it looks old because of how much I have take off in the sharpening process.
I got this for a 10 gallon fish tank so that my fish doesn't jump out. It works good. I eouldn't reccommend it for snakes or anything that is strong or can climb (They will definitely escape ). It works really good for the fish though.
"We use these for the gun range target backers, these save us TONS of times. Use the backers way more than before, and in a pinch these can be used as target patches too ( we use several colors but sometimes run out)"
"Thought this dress was so beautiful and was so excited, but after inspecting it following my frist time wearing it the seams around the piping have begun to fray after only one wear. Extremely disappointed as originally I was going to order every color!"
"Had issues with the first one that I received and the seller reached out to me to make it better. They sent me a new set that, so far, haven't had any issues and print great. Much better value than factory toner."
Adorable!  It is very soft to the touch.  The compartments and slots are useful and it holds everything you need in a wallet. The zipper is smooth and I have no problems with it so far.  Got to have this if you area a fan of Rilakkuma.
I love it but it's bloody giant. Ordered 6-12 months (90) and it would probably fit my 16 month old nephew. It's beautifully made but the sizing is all over the place judging from other reviews. Do they even care what they put in the bag?
"This is what we use at the hospital.  I bought one for my other job because it can be hard to find gait belts there, for some stupid reason.  Buy this one not a cheaper one, it is strong easy to use and you can clean it."
"We have not used this product yet. It was bought for the upcoming school year. It looks great, looks well made, and it is the perfect size. I will update when we find out how long it lasts my two boys."
"It's winter. In Wisconsin. I need to keep my legs warm when wearing dresses! Works great with boots. The only reason that I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because they are not 100% opaque. Not see through, but a bit light."
Quite bendable and long my Chamaeleon seems to like it very much some of these branches like this are made from not very strong material that doesn’t seem to last this One is particularly not like that it’s made from a hard material Nice product
"This is a great little affordable tool to get your finances in order!  This was just what I needed to get started. Love that it's hardbound, and love the cover.  The pages are very helpful 🙌.  Love it!"
"This stuff is actual magic. I washed a pair of sweatpants 5 times and the grease stains wouldn’t come out, I was so bummed. I randomly found this in my drawer and figured I might as well try one last Hail Mary. It took the grease right out!!! Incredible!"
My 4 year old loves this but it’s a pain and super loose and doesn’t hold its transformation well at all and just flops around. I have to transform it every .0003 seconds and it doesn’t stay. It’s a great size but I want it to disappear.
Too tight on bust / under arms yet swimmingly super large over waist hips and butt.  Side Slit to high to walk outside in wind.  ( like need bike shorts underneath)  I am proportional. This can only fit someone who is more pear shaped than hourglass
My wife had open heart surgery and we needed something that she could ring when she needed me. Her voice was weak so I knew something like that wouldn't work. This was perfect. She just pressed it and I could heart it and see it. Great help to us.
"The earrings arrived on-time in a very nice box and bag. From a distance, the earrings look pretty nice and shiny, but when I look closely, the bezel is not concentric, and the gold color is rubbed off at the stem of one of the earrings."
This item was described as bulk with a picture of 4 or 5 bones.When it arrived there was one bone in the package at a cost of $7.23. Locally I can buy one for less than $2 . If you like getting screwed buy from this seller NYCPETSUPPLY!!
"I use these every day to get my black lab's hair off my bed. The Scotch Brite rollers are by far the best and tear evenly and easily. Don't waste your money on the cheaper ones.Believe me, I have tried them all."
"This was a nice puzzle, but I am missing a piece. So sad, just doesn't feel the same as actually finishing it.I know the company will send me a replacement puzzle,...After I hack the box apart and go send them all the info through the US postal service. How retro!"
"not what i thougth i got was wanting math X's on for a teacher for a gift but just got # and very light so i dont think they would stay on long would have been great if it was a multiplication one , very sad"
I LOVE this sweater!! Came just on time and could not be softer. Extremely cute and I plan on wearing it very often. There was even a cute little package included with a sweet message from Pinksee saying thank you. Definitely plan on buying from here again!!
My 6 year old rabbit boycotts all pellets except this brand. His vet says he is healthy and he has a nice coat of fur. I will continue to buy this because they do not carry it at pet stores.
I needed a place on my desk to store all the papers and things that get shuffled around every time I need to do something. This works great. Easy to put together and it has a nice weight to it.
Doesn't really massage but kneads in certain areas.  I couldn't relax with it on; I may use it if I had sore muscles back there.  It's OK for the low cost as I have seen some in excess of $100.
I can' t tell any difference between this product and any generic wipe.  Except the cost.  Also leaves a film and is not easy to remove from container without pulling out two dozen sheets at a time.  Went from exercise room to trash.
My lab started getting what I thought was acne on her lips and chin and was becoming worse so a friend recommended this and I must say the very first application and the sores started disappearing and over a few applications they were completely gone..
"Nice set for preschooler who likes to build.  Combines small buildings with several people (very important).  Well made and colorful.  Assembly as pictured requires adult help for 3 year old initially.  Great toy for learning, imagination and dexterity."
"A 23 yr AFOL here. Though a first timer (for lego technic), I've been an avid fan of lego since childhood. This is my first lego technic toy, so it took me some time for building . But I've enjoyed building, and it looks great."
Looked like it had already been used and had scratches on it when I received it. It didn't do a good job straightening parts of my hair with shorter layers. Made my hair look frizzy. I've owned many Sedu flat irons and have never been disappointed until now.
I have trouble wearing them because they are silky and every time you take a breath they suck against your mouth or nose.  I wish they had a sturdy strip of something that would hold it away from your face just a bit.
"Great product!! We love it, but please do not buy from this dealer - antonline....they overprice stuff and do not honor the Amazon Low Price guarantee, ripped me off for 200$ on a TV which we bought. So watch out and get it somewhere else...thanks!"
"One of my ""tic tok made me buy it"" purchases. This toothbrush is very soft but since I wasnt used to it, it didnt seem like it was cleaning my teeth properly. Now when I use another toothbrush, it seems so rough on my gums."
"It wasn’t worth what I paid, but was the only Milli I could find to replace the one my daughter lost.  She adores it.  I feel like I paid $20 for a happy meal toy.  She really loves it though."
"I absolutely love this necklace! I ordered it back in May and have worn it almost every day since. It’s survived the shower, lake, and everyday wear. I have super sensitive skin so it was nice to find a piece of jewelry that I can wear for only $5!"
"heard about these maps while riding in Colorado with Motorcycle Relief Project! Great organization for disabled veterans. but these maps are amazing. waterproof, tare proof and so informative. I bought 2. one for my bike and one to hangup to use for our group to plan routes!"
"The HP 23 Tri-color Ink Cartridge shipped very quickly, but the product did not function correctly.  There was no blue ink in the unit. I contacted the seller but got no response. I will contact the seller again today to give them another chance to make it right."
I just started my second bottle.  I must say I haven't seen any change so far but I'm going to continue for another  month and see what happens.  I couldn't give it more stars at this point. I will give another review after I complete this one.
Did extensive research and there is nothing else in the retail market place like this drink. I have bought and tried all kinds of proteins and omegas from nutrition shops and this product is amazing. You can begin to feel results in just days (at least my experience).
This is my second Canon printer. Last one (an older model) lasted 2 yrs. & screen locked up with an error code which I never found a way to clear and I could not print. Hope this doesn't happen with this one.
"We really enjoyed playing this game, it took a few rounds to get a feel for it but once we did it was lots of fun.They take an innovative approach which has everyone more active and animated which is always fun."
Ordered he large  one but the one I received was tiny.  IT IS nothing like what is advertised.  EVEN the picture is different from the junk I received. very unhappy and will not order from this company again
"Bust is  baggy, while sleeves too tight. I suppose someone with something over a 36 C might fill it out, but better have thin arms. The ad said the fabric was comfortable, and I should have asked why. The fabric traps body heat."
The bracelet part isn’t too bad but the charm looks like it came out of a gumball machine or cereal box or something. It seems like plastic with a paper sticker on it. The whole thing is worth a couple bucks at most. It’s being returned this week.
Pretty but could hold up to the New York rain storm. We bought 2 and used them for the first time in New York and they both got damaged in a rain storm with just a small about it wind.
I didn’t realize this was a concentrate until after the kids made a huge mess with it BUT the bubbles didn’t pop when they landed on stuff so they still loved it. I just had to spray down the side of the house and our porch afterward.
"I like the combination since it seems to appeal to the fish. Nice size bag to give things a try without forced to spend a lot only to learn they don't like it. I wish the bag was easier to re-seal but otherwise, good blend."
"This bracelet exceeds my expectations.  It's intricately carved and even though it's not real silver, it is beautiful.  Nice shiny, consistent finish.  It arrived on time and in excellent condition.  I recommend it and would buy from this company again."
I've used B-complex my entire adult life and never have I come across a product that is so effective. Easy to swallow and no after taste. I really enjoyed the benefits of it being a balanced B-complex and I didn't have the need to take additional b12.
Love these bars for breakfast! The only thing you need  consider is Amazon doesn't shop with cooler packs to keep your items from melting so I can only order these if I'm going to be home the day they arrive... learned that the hard way.
Buffalo Games puzzles are the best and compares with the quality of Ravensburger.  If I get the chance to own a Buffalo puzzle I jump at the chance.  The pictures are very vivid and colorful.  Highly recommended.
"I used this for the first time at roller derby practice last night.  Works well, comfortable, able to talk and drink.  Exactly as advertised and excellent service.  Thank you!!!  I would highly recommend this product and this seller to anyone."
I am a fan of homeboy- Anthony Davis. I am also new to Funko POP and trying not to get addicted. This model was at a great price but maybe somewhat over dependent on the uni-brow for charicature— other figures more descriptive.
Now that WFH teleconferences are a norm this little Anker pod has become a necessity. It makes calls on both conference platforms and cell phones a breeze and absolutely makes a day that was previously spent with headphones on much more enjoyable.
I really like this top it’s a stretchy material I read the reviews and decided to gonone size bigger. It did fit me big from the top a little not something that I couldn’t handle. I will order more I loved it! The quality is worth it...
Seen a lot of different models on my Facebook  other cost double this. For the price it works great for a deep massage and loosens up a tight muscle no issue. Comes with two batteries and charger and a couple different  style heads
"I like using clear acrylic boards. They are easy to clean and have a stylish look to them. These boards come with 6 markers, an eraser and a holder. The best thing is that they are magnetic. You can use them on your refrigerator or a metal door."
"I’ve been looking for some comfy shorts to wear while exercising or just lounging around the house and these definitely fit the bill. That said, they’re a little longer than I thought they’d be from the pictures. They come down about mid-thigh on me, though I am short at 5’0”."
The gold one works best. Silver is iffy and the pink one is useless. Unless I go over the writing twice it doesn’t show up on the paper. I bought this pens to write over the dark region on my notes but it doesn’t work really well on it.
"Doesn’t create the best gloss, but if you prepare the paint and apply it then it sure is great.Smells like products of old, but it’s a breeze to use.For a car that spends its time outside, it’s great to have."
"Covers well and well made, but the 7 year old I purchased for wouldn’t use it bc it was too tight on his arm. I met a woman who had the same one on at the beach and said she LOVED it and it was super helpful."
"I liked the collar.  It was sturdy enough to keep my kitty from irritating an already sore belly.  Kitty didn't like it so much, but it'll be good to have on hand should she need to wear it again."
"This would have gotten five stars but I ordered the blue dog for my little boy and got the pink unicorn when it arrived at my door , so it came down to my daughter getting it instead , she enjoys it a lot but son was disappointed"
I'm pretty happy about this purchase.  I can't believe the money saved going with this product over name brand.  Shipping was next business day and arrived on time.  Will definitely be purchasing from them again.  What a lucky find.
"Cute but extremely heavy.  I have 3 badges on this and the weight causes the flower to hang down instead of upright.  Too bad.  Might hold up under less weight but doubt it, it's really top heavy."
I received one float.  The mesh and inflatable material is very thin.  I have not inflated it yet so I do not know if it leaks.  I doubt it would hold an adult up without the side pieces.  You get what you pay for.
This is an excellent product and my cat loves it HOWEVER at $42.90 for 24 cans that comes out to $1.78 per can.  Target sells this product for $0.75 per can and even Petsmart sells this for under a $1.00 per can.  This no bargain whatsoever.
Bought these for my son he loves Stuffed animals and was super thrilled to receive these! We washed them and he has played a little rough with them the blue one ripped a little on the leg but nothing a couple stitches couldn’t fix. They are super soft and colorful!
"This is a great pen!  Heavy weight (nice) and writes very smooth.  I would buy again.  The store I saw it in was sold out, they only had the demo pen.  Fortunately Amazon had it and for less money!"
This product must have been second quality to begin with as it wouldn't hold a full charge for even 48 hrs. I have had several V-Tech phones in the past and have had no problems until now. Return and refund with no problem
Don't buy this if you want to use it all the time. It works ok as a rubber band shooter. It sometimes falls apart but is easy to fix. Bought it as a stocking stuffer and I wasn't expecting much.
I work at a daycare and it’s super easy to plug in and start! Batteries didn’t last too long but I didn’t expect them to. We use the machine at least once a day for 20-30 minutes and it’s still working great!
"It seems to run a little smaller than expected, but I can tell the fabric is high quality.  As long as it doesn't shrink, it should fit him just fine.  I'd definitely order from this seller again, I'd just order the next size up."
"Super fun! Most people were wearing red, white, and blue - but this added more Olympic spirit their attire.My only criticism is that they came packaged with all the reds together, all the yellows together - it took a little bit of time to group in a Olympic color set."
There are so many different kinds of papers available and they all seem to be quite good quality.  These Cut Corners were a favorite years ago.  They're a little shorter than a lot of papers and I like that.
I didn't realize that this was an assorted color deals. It doesn't say that in the description and I assumed I would get the green and blue pictured. I was very disappointed that I instead got purple and pink which I hate.
I ordered an XLARGE and it fit perfect.  Hits right above the knee.  Great coverage I am a 38DDD.  I took a small hair tie and took some fabric at the bottom on one side and made a little “bun” which gave it a little better extra!
a Bit tighter than I expected.  I’m in between a large and XL so the XL slowly falls down as I run but the large is tight.Hoping as I search for the perfect pair I’ll lose the gut and Large will be it!
"These sponge refills last less than a day because the adhesive they used to stick the sponge to the plastic connector does not hold. I used a few hoping the first one was a fluke, but it happened to the next 2 as well. I wouldn't recommend these."
"This left a sticky, greasy film on my dogs and in my tub.  Castile soap bars are not for coated dogs like poodles or bichons, maybe for short coated dogs like boston terriers or jack russell.  I will not buy again."
We were looking for an option to do a drive thru raffle and these were perfect. One sheet of 25 chances and all we did was write the name and phone number of the purchaser on a numbered sheet. Simple and easy!
"this is wonderfull it measures in Kg,poundes,oz and one i didnt recognize maybe gramms. works great but it locks in the number a little to fast, nice thing is just hit the power button 1 time and it unlocks it five stars all the way"
These cards are great! Exactly what you see on the preview. I love clouds and weather so I was thrilled to find cloud thank you cards. They are great! The people who received the cards also loved them. They'd never seen cloud &#34;thank you&#34; cards.
The chipset is worth the price. The only annoying thing is that some of the stickers do fall off. I would keep a glue handy because the adhesive doesn't hold for the some of the chips. The weight feels nice and this gives you a COOL factor with your buddies.
This is a pretty uncomfortable rust pad. O got the standard slim rest pad and it is just like cardboard with a  it of padding. The material isn't comfortable at all. Idk why there are so many good reviews? I was disappointed.
I guess I didn't read the fine print. I should have gotten it from the official website. I got a USED but paid for a NEW price plus shipping.  Just be careful these days. Here is the real website [...] Good Luck!
I bought these for a teacher to use in her classroom.  She reports that they are holding up well so far (it has been a week) and the students loved the colors.  She said the color choices are their favorite part.  Thanks for making a fun product.
"The leather was thinner than I expected. Also, when bent the opposite curvature of the waists, it has a blistered look.  (Not a good sign for long term usage.)I was looking for a HIGH quality belt.  This didn’t do it for me."
"This cat collar is exactly as described.  It has a little breakaway clip with a tiny little bell.  This seems solidly constructed and the design is pretty.  There is a loop to attach a tag to, if your cat goes outside."
"I really liked the shape of the bowl and the idea of the stand, unfortunately it just didn't work out for my cat. She tends to push her bowl around and this just isn't sturdy enough to withstand that type of movement."
"My kitty, Rosey, absolutely LOVES her rainbow!! There's already some teeth and claw holes in it, but she plays very rough with her toys. This is the only catnip toy she has ever shown interest in. It's well worth the money!"
"What I wanted but I wish I could find them in Acrylic because makeup gets on them and its so hard to get it off of the wood, but I love these, they're classic and never go out of style!"
As long as the dog is walking forward it works great.  If the dog is dawdling and you need to pull it to encourage it to walk with you it is a pain because the dog can slip right out of it.
My vet recommended this for my aging cat who was barely moving around. Within 2-3 weeks my Ole Guy was playing with our other cat which he hadn't done in months. Price on Amazon was better than from Vet office.
We got a new puppy and his nails were very sharp. This grander was easy to use and helped fix the sharp nails. The puppy was a bit afraid but because it’s not loud or anything he got over it quickly.
My dog hasn't had hip problems before - but she's an 8 year old Doberman.  I give her these pills to prevent aging/hip problems.  She has been on them for well over a year.  She likes the taste and eats them right up.
It fits OK but I couldn't zip close. I live alone and maybe if I found another person to help it could have been done.I love the look and the color is amazing. Just need to be more flexible to zip sooo...
"It arrived on time. it smells great, I've used it in my diffuser,  added it to my lotion I make & put a fee drops in my all natural clean and clear dish soap. My husband and I love lemongrass"
Got this for my husband to deal with joint pain! He hasn’t noticed a difference yet since we just started but love that the ingredients are clean and natural : the best way to heal and treat any symptoms!! Want to try out other products by ZenFuel!
Very realistic! I was skeptical at first but I bought because I wanted to propose unconventionally. My fiancée loves scratch offs and I found this. It was a huge success and she couldn't tell the difference. The last line reveals she won and the reward says will you marry me
They showed In a picture like it's a hard board type but the material is like a paper it's all crunchy has lines on it because it came in such a small box folded. Would not recommend it at all.
Such a beautiful true to life stuffed animal for My grandson’s room.. The packing did cause the horns to flatten a bit...and lay back to far on his head though..That kinda ruined it’s effect! Should be packed with protectors around the horns.. Especially for the price...
"Actually, the UVB light is for a bearded dragon which is necessary for them to get the vitamin D that they need. The bulbs are packaged well, a lot better than the UVA bulbs that I bought. Both necessary for reptiles!"
This is a great calendar.  Just the right size for the refrigerator with excellent magnets.  Very funny pics and great size blocks for writing appointments etc.  Wish the print was a bit darker but I still enjoy it.
"Had to give it a bad review all around. Couldn't try it, could not get past the new tire smell. I could not return it so I gave it to my physical therapist mabe she can give it to somebody who isn't so scent sensitive and can benefit from it."
"The price is ridiculously over priced, but I now see why they can get away with it, it’s a very good product I have customers who literally slam my back door closed & it holds strong, and  my business cards stay in place."
I bought it for my grandson who is four years old. He loves Pokémon the show and he wanted me to buy this one.  This Pokémon is his favorite. Not big at all. Could fit in his small hands. Nice toy.
Got this for our dog for Christmas. He loved it but 5 minutes in and it was completely destroyed. I knew that it wouldn't last long when I got it since he destroys all his toys. But I was hoping it would last longer.
We have a blended family of sorts with kids ranging from 9-28 and 7 grands! This “game” was enjoyed by all. We took it on an all family camping trip and everyone got into. Great conversation starter! Help create a meaningful time together!
"This is a good quality cube-my 10 year old loves it. He says it has good turning-not a fast cube but one he can figure out and others can’t. So this has passed the ‘multiple kid’ quality test, lol!  So you shouldn’t have any issues of it breaking"
My nephew had me purchase some of these at a store and for 1 figure and the fighting stand it was $15 so this was a great value for him for his Birthday present. Came in a box sealed and brand new!
I tried these on myself and seen very little reaction. Cousin loved the thought but the purpose of it was not realistic enough. I'm sure it would need to be consistent and over years and time to ACTUALLY see results.
Claire Burke Original Home Fragrance Spray is to die for. My wife asks for Claire Burke each Christmas. Ugly odor in a room? A couple of brief &quot;squirts&quot; and the odor is replaced by a most wonderful fragrance. Well worth the cost and much better than other sprays.
"The sculpt, paintwork, and box of the figure was all very good but the Iggy head was broken almost immediately after trying to switch them, Joseph's stand is incredibly loose, and his leg looks as if it's about to pop out of its socket"
so I have a tumor in my spine l3 I lost my movement on my left leg decided to try this but is not too helpful is very loose for a person who lost all of its muscles. Not good for physical therapy starters is very loose.
"This is the best smelling cleaner, hands down. Not overwhelming or perfumy or flowery. Faint minty smell. I wish they had other types of cleaners in this smell, like scrubs, hand soap, dish soap, laundry detergent, fabric softener. I LOOOOOVE it"
Purchased these puzzle blocks for toddler for play and to begin teaching color and pattern recognition along with puzzle solving skills. Each of the four puzzles have a different background color/pattern. The pictures pieces match up perfectly. Very pleased with the quality of this product.
"My wife is in a memory care uynit.  I gave this to her for Christmas, and it instantly reminded her of the horse she used to have, so it as well worth the money.  It does need some additiional supporet in the neck area."
I buy Keepsake Ornaments every year for my great-grandchildren. They LOVE these ornaments and look forward each year to getting another one to hang on the tree.  It is a tradition now that I will continue for as long as I can.
Love filofax pocket!!! I use it as a wallet and I am so happy how easy it is to get to my cards and cash! I even put my checkbook in the back slot! I receive so many compliments on it☺️
Everything was great except the heart balloons done have tabs on the top to hand them. They are located at the bottom and when hanging it together with the letters they don't stay upright so I had to leave them down
"So useful for organizing, scavenger hunts (under rock for next clue) and you can change the info in the app, add pics, and website link. I took a pic if the business card one to add to physical business cards."
"I bought this for my daughter after I see a viral video on tik tok. I got her the pink one, and absolutely loves it. It plays baby shark and bubbles comes out of its mouth the entire time she was in the tub!"
"These are great. We have many wild swans, geese, and ducks in our coastal lagoons, and people all to often feed them bread, which is terrible for them and the environment. I bought these for myself and neighbors and highly recommend them on our community pages !"
I couldn't wait to receive my order of Dancing Daisies so that I could share them with my friends!!  Just to walk in my kitchen andsee ours dancing away is a perfect way to start the day!!!  Everyone should own one or more!!!  Audrey Jean Naughton
What I liked about this was the fit.  My dog is somewhere between a small and medium.  I bought several mediums and this is the only one that fit my puppy.  I would especially recommend it if you have a growing puppy.
I tried my new insole today inside my Keen hiking boots. Work well in my boots. I was hiking over rocks and tree roots. My feet love them. The semi flexible plastic plates under the insoles support my medial and lateral arches. Well made!
"So far I am enjoying it! Easy to use and fast delivery. In the past, whenever I have  ordered from an overseas company it can take 2-3 months to receive your item so now I only order from the USA!"
"I order two pairs - a black and a blue. They looked good, but actually are an awful fit. The blue pair came with a scratched lens. Returning them is just a hassle.  Choose a different eyeglass reader vendor!"
My vet recommended this for my dog who has skin allergies. This conditioner helps to relieve my dog all year round allergies. It doesn't completely stop her from licking or scratching but she's gets relieve throughout the day and is now able to sleep all night whereas she wasn't before
"I'm not kitting, this is amazing. Less than 24hrs I received a call from my ex attorney (15yrs haven't heard from him) soon as I answered he said it was my lucky day. Made me an offer I couldn't refuse. Lots of money 💰 🤑"
I didn't know anything about these when I bought them for my 6 and 7 year old boys. They aren't paper - they are plastic and durable. The kids love them. I do wish that they had better songs already downloaded.
"My dog loves to sit out side all day and she was getting bare spots on her fur, now with her comfy mat she is cushioned from the hard ground. It's made out of a great material and just the thing for what we needed it for."
Really nice Cami. I got this to wear as medium compression after surgery. I find the panty girdle kind of compression to be uncomfy. This is very comfy and does the trick for medium compression. Love it. Step into it to put it on.
This car seat worked out perfectly when I picked my puppy up 2 hours away by myself. He was safe and comfortable! He is 25 pounds now and he still has room to grow in it! It also doubles as a salon chair when he comes to work with me!
Got these to make an Aggravation board game. I also changed the rules slightly.. with these dice they have colors on each side so I made the rules that to get out of home someone has to roll your color. It’s awesome!
I specifically ordered these because I wanted signs that didn’t reveal too much of my young kids’ personal info. These are perfect and I love that they send all of the grade levels in one package. They’re super sturdy and a great value - glad I ordered these!
"This color is definitely not holding up as well as the two hot pink ones I purchased for my other dogs.  Even though it is the newest, it is already faded and some of the reflective bones have peeled away."
"Mi pit bull tiene cierto nivel de desgaste en las articulaciones de las patas traseras por lo que el veterinario me recomendó Dasuquin para prevenir que dicha condición avance. Desde que lo toma regularmente, mi perrita no ha tenido episodios de dolor o incomodidad."
"This puzzle is gorgeous. The colors are bright and vivid, and the gold foil is really nice. It’s very sturdy and my boys love putting it together. Just be aware that it’s not as large as a typical floor puzzle."
"Shipped as expected, on time, very cute gift wrap box, elegant and beautiful earrings! My daughter in laws birthday is May 18th, so this was a perfect gift to share with a story of the eruption of MT. St. Helens (I was in Bellevue Wa at the time). Thank you!!!"
This dress is cheap. It’s box-ie so you really gotta dress it up with like a big necklace or a belt or something to give you some sort of a figure. The material is cheap and it ripped after only wearing it twice!
"My cat woods down food and needs lots of things to keep her entertained, so this is a perfect combo! We are in stage one to get use to it and will be going up a level soon. I like she can learn and develop with it."
"This product is excellent and is proving to be the best way for me to take and absorb DHEA. An added bonus is the scent of this product is very uplifting snd fresh. Also, the texture is also excellent. Overall, I couldn’t be happier with this purchase."
"The cellophane package containing the cards was obviously damaged - it was torn in two, ragged and contained only about half the number of cards. I have no idea why it was even shipped like that.  The damage was obvious."
This is so beautiful! I'm 5' 1&#34; 112lbs 34D and ordered a small.  Fits like a glove. The jeweled detail is fancy and doesn't look cheap!  I bought the pink and white and the colour scheme is on point. I can't wait to wear!
Very useful for certain areas.  Wouldve given it 5 stars if they had a magnetic option instead of only using the strong adhesive (which I won't put on my car).  Other than that the adhesive is very strong and holds up well.
This pack has six totally different chews for plenty of variety. My miniature husky has enjoyed them so far. My dachshund not so much due to the size of the chews being bigger so definitely for the larger breeds. If you want something different this pack is the one.
"Bought these as party favors for my two year old’s llama birthday and they were such a hit!! I paid for expedited shipping, I really didn’t know if they were going to make it in time and was super impressed that they did."
This room spray smells so good and has a nice mist when spraying it. It is actually strong and with just a few sprays make a house smell so fresh and clean. It's a good size bottle and will last awhile for me. It arrived fast and was packaged well.
"This 1000-count bottle of laxatives is perfect for your zombie apocalypse bunker.  After all, once our food stores are depleted, we will have to resort to cannabalism to survive, and everyone knows how the Atkins Diet makes you constipated."
"Was very disheartened by this item. Barely fits what it says it would, barely used by ferrets no matter how I try to entice them. Instead, go with a ferret super thru way, or a ferret fun tube, or some other kind of plastic, pvc, or vinyl tubing."
"If you buy a Mist King system prepare to be surprised whenever you are forced to pay another $10 for this piece of plastic. This is obviously taking advantage of the consumer. Mist King, you need to include this in your system, no excuse for why it is not included."
"These are literally the BEST. After wasting years with those stupid stick on ones that fall off (allowing furniture to scratch up the hardwood floors) I finally found the best solution. These stay on and work great, just measure appropriately for the chair leg."
"Had read so many suggestions to buy this pencil, and I'm glad I jumped on the bandwagon.  Metal construction, and is comfortable to hold.  Ingenious lead advance mechanism through the cap.  People ask me if it is a pen."
"I was a little upset when I opened the package and it did not include the colors it shows in the picture. It only included black, red, clear and pink.  The biggest reason why I bought these was because there was so many different colors not just the four."
Great product!! Use it for our goats and poultry/waterfowl. Package has a different looking cover than what's in the picture but word for word same product when comparing vitamin amounts. Glad it's a 3 pack. Used to get a 2 pack and went through it fast.
"My husband purchase this item and thou he really likes it, i think it’s uncomfortable. Every time I need to get a card or something out of it I struggle. Like all cards get stuck together. He should of just stood with the simple money clip he had."
"China shipped, so it's a bit to get here, but really high craftsmanship (I'd personally love to see how this glass is blown, lol) and the style, shape, usability is right up our alley. Great purchase if the wait was shorter. good one with the wait."
"I should have watched the video first. It looks great but roll it three inches and all of the shapes pop off. Amusing the first time, but not the third, fourth. Frustrated mom and grandson as he wanted to push the tractor with the numbers but they won’t stay on."
"These are highly detailed dinosaur hand puppets, made of soft rubber-like material. They will fit the hand of children, but adults will need to struggle to get them on. Be careful that you don't overstretch the mouth of the puppet; better to leave them to the kids."
I've been using these as my designated fishing glasses ever since I bought em. I wear them for a long time and they haven't bothered my ears or nose. I also usually end up fishing while the sun's up and it makes it very comfortable fishing. Definitely recommend.
My 13 year old dog has eaten this her entire life due to colitis. She never eats other snacks and never &#34;people food.&#34;She is still very active and in great shape.  I purchased this via Amazon when I needed it in a hurry after I moved.
I say you can't have too many Smash pads.  But this one is great because you make the sheets into anything you want.  Great for journaling and lists in your Smash book. this is like a &#34;create it yourself&#34; smash pad.
This poster was laminated and ready to use. I needed to use the days of the week on my chalkboard so I cut out each day. Worked perfect for my project. Nice big words that are easy to read across the room.
"Nice size, and the elastic band is a plus. However, the paper is a little bit thin; I've had issues with inks bleeding through. I use mine for bullet journaling, and this works well for that purpose. It's definitely not thick enough for watercolor, though."
"I love this float better than any other one I have tried. It is more durable and long lasting. The mesh is more like fabric instead of a plastic, which is more comfortable to sit in. Plus you get 2 in the package instead of one."
Tic Tac Toe game didn't come with with 5 and 4 pegs.. rather 6 of one color and 3 of another...  What do you do with that?  Quality control. The other games were very small travel size.  Okay for the price.
All the keys don't work and took forever to get it and wanted me to pay return shipping and Amazon told me they were going to take care of it and did nothing but told me to ship it back at my cost!
Holy schmolly these are stinking cute and comfortable! They make your backside your best asset. The only negative is the need more colors!! A solid black is always my first choice bc of its versatility so I'll settle for gray. And every other available color :)
"Very disappointing.  At first they loved it. As they continued to play, the white pieces of the stick with the feathers broked the very same day I got the toy. Not recommended.  Now I got light up ball sitting around vibrating!😩☹I want a refund."
"Definitely gives you some added support. I wish it gave you a little more or had a thicker option with more support, like df levels. I still Recommend it bc it helps and I still use it. Just an added safety of you have an injury or week ankle."
There weren’t 4 assorted designs.  Received a box with 24 witch hats.  Super disappointed kiddos.  Bummer!!!! The pad part is minimal so you will need another bandaid.  Wish I would have read the reviews.  Will probably let them use as stickers!!!!
I love these eye necklaces which are part of an outfit for a themed party cruise.  A little too big but I can get away with the size (I hope).  The theme party on the ship is the 5 senses.
The translation is pretty good.  After a few uses the screen starting acting up.  It would show random colors and sometimes it would be fuzzy rendering the product useless.  I tried to update the firmware to no avail.
"As far as flavor, I am not tasting it but my two labs LOVE it. Millie is picky. She selectively eats the other flavors but will eat the chicken wings every time!  Neither dog gets weary of this flavor."
"My son absolutely  loves his mask, wears it all the time. It has a nice foam cushion forehead seat up front (I'm noting that because I borrowed his mask for halloween) hee hee.  He wears this mask constantly, for a 10 year old who loves TMNT."
"Works perfectly. I use it in a shower since I developed balance problems with neuropathy. A great advantage is that it is easy to remove and re position if you decide another location is more convenient. Yet, once in place, it holds firmly."
This is the best bed for my 2 adult cats. They love sleeping together & this bed is super soft. Every time I go in their cat bedroom they are curled up enjoying this bed. I wish I would've bought it a long time ago!
I just liked the moment I opened the package. It being white color feels pretty cute to wear. It’s better to size up if you want it comfortable as suggested. It’s breathable with lot of embroidery work on whole dress.
"It’s basically a great toy but give it to a younger child. A teenager might feel it’s a little cheap. Also, I’d buy two so a kid can race with another kid. At the price point, buying 2 is a good call."
Great flavor and texture. I usually mix mine with unsweetened almond milk and water but you can simply use water if it fits your macros better. I wish all the ARN products were available on Amazon but you can order directly from ARN if you want the full selection.
I loved the larger size of the box for the dishwasher salt.  This size limits the number of small boxes that are thrown out.  The box contains the same great unscented dishwasher salt that I used to purchase in smaller boxes.
I've tried a few different ramps for my dog but this one's perfect. He's able to grip the ramp very well with his tiny paws. Other ramps he would fall down the but not this one. Easy to use great adjustable heights works for my bed and my couch.
"On first use the white top handle frayed; otherwise, the luggage held up well.  The wheels were great--a lot easier to maneuver!  Nice look, allowing for easy identification. I'm just hoping the set will stand up to baggage claim handling."
It’s true you get what you pay for. When batterie are inserted the on off switch does not turn off. Just touch the fan and it stops running so no way can you “vacuum” your dog because it stops running. Too cheap to return so it’s trash
"IF YOU THINK YOU ARE GETTING THE OFFICIAL BON TEH RABBIT PLUSH FROM MAKESHIFT, YOU ARE WRONG!The image does not match the doll at all, even the official makeshift tag does not exist!This piece is just the cheap knock off!!"
"I love these they work great for me, I live in Florida and the sun is horrible here. These are a life saver for me at my work as a crossing guard for an elementary school as I'm in the sun for 2 hours a day."
"Nice strong balloons. Great quality. Only one complaint was that I got deep pink balloons in the packs (not many). Looking at the picture it looks like two different shades of purple, which would of been acceptable. Didn’t use the pink ones but wasn’t a big deal. Recommended otherwise"
I pressed the button and the note just kept coming..: and coming… and coming. Nearly a third of the roll wasted because the button was faulty. Only way to stop it was to remove the batteries. Not even worth returning. Went straight into the trash.
"Please do not buy these paper towels. Why are we being forced to use"" select a size""  when full sized is softer, more absorbent and often reusable? This product was a complete disappointment. The sheets described as full size were not. The paper is flimsy, rough and unabsorbent.."
I am so pleased that I purchased this as now I am not so out of breath when I go shopping and running around the RV Park.  Need to teach my puppy to walk with me while I am on this.
In your mind you think 8 x 10 isn't that big but its the paper inside that is only that size then the cover is a few inches as well.  It's very pretty just be sure you aren't trying to put it into a small space.
"This is a nice sweater, better quality than I expected for the price. Fabric is soft, yet sturdy, and appears warm but not suffocating. Color was true, as was the fit:  I'm 5'7&#34;, 146 #, and it fit me exctly as pictured."
"I first bought these at a store. During the time when they were not in the stores. I checked on Amazon and was able to order them. My beagle loves these, plus he gets the benefits of glucosamine in a crunchy tasty biscuit !!!"
"Very cute dress for the price, but the fabric is super itchy! This dress has no lining. And, the hem was horribly uneven! Took it to my seamstress to even out, but it may end up being too short once it's fixed. Oh, well...still a cute dress though."
"These seem to work for our kitties, a couple of which suffer from Cat herpes. The only thing I can say is I think they might be flavorless because the cats get bored with them. We supplement other treats to keep them interested."
My 4 yr old was so excited to have his but it does not stand erect! Balls would not roll because of the leaning. I tried more air and I tried less. I had to hold it straight. No good for the money.
Using this tough carryall bag to haul logs in from outside.  It can carry 8 or so logs.  it really cuts down on the mess in the house because all the wood chips are contained in this bag.  it is very sturdy.  really happy with purchase.
If you loved the Jetson's as a child you need this little one.  It looks exactly like the character from the cartoon.  It comes in the original package.  Fast shipping and it will bring back happy childhood memories.
The description states the hat is heavy-duty but this is not the case. It’s the exact  flimsy material of the hat that Firehouse Subs gives out to kids for free. My toddler destroyed it in about 20 minutes. Not worth your money.
"This is CLASSIC formula. I have rusty water, which leaves stains. I use the works that clears my rust stains on contact. Some scrubbing is needed, but I see a difference immediately. With THIS formula, there is no difference, even after scrubbing. I was quite disappointed."
These are seriously so cute. I usually order bandanas off Etsy but they can get expensive so I tried this 4 pack and was really happy with what I got! The material is almost silky and they seem really well made! Recommend!
"Very cute. I have a 14 lb fur baby, looks very cute in them but sleeves are just a bit long. Ordered size medium. Shirts shrink a bit, dried one in dryer to see. Line drying from now on. Price and quantity are good."
"These were excellent for the price. Sturdy, not overly yellow lenses, trendy, and the case it came with was also excellent. Overall, I didn't end up keeping them because they weren't my favorite style for me personally, but otherwise I was super happy with the quality."
"Bought this for a cruise, as they come in very handy. Leopard print is very nice and the 3/4 size is perfect and soft to wear around the neck. Also the length works very well~! Will definitely be using this for the trip~!!"
"My error I didn't realize that the pieces would be this small, I'm talking micro small. It's a 1000 piece puzzle, but I thought the pieces would be larger.. the saving grace is that they are numbered. I'm sure I'll get around to putting it together one day."
The material is good but the words are cut off. For the money I spent I would have thought the quality would be better. I should be able to read what is supposed to be printed. Kinda disappointed... Most likely won't buy from this seller again.
Seems expensive for what it is. Looks like the fake coin came damaged. My child is fine with it so I will get over the shock of purchasing elastic and safety pins with a teeny tiny nickel for almost 30 bucks..... eventually....I hope.
"As per the instructions which are very clear, the cartridges showed up as full right away. Printed a test page with zero errors followed up by an 8x10 glossy full color photo. Did great and if the price stays the same, will buy again."
Well worth the price compared to other scrappers and nets I've used in the past. net is small but I use it for cory cats and bettas. The scrub brush is not the greatest but the scrapper is what I use most for algae control.
These are thick and durable. Easy install on the front but the back is tricky. They do function and work like real sway bars if mounted correctly.Tip: Reinforce the front bumper to stiffen the front end for a better performance.
Item was not as sturdy as it appeared in the description. I would not trust my $800 phone to protecting this curved screen. Edges of screen (glass) are exposed and not fully protected. Spent the extra $10 and bought a real protective case.
"The little plaque is ok but the size is wrong! It measures 3"" by 1 5/8"" which is not what the description says! So it is too big for what I wanted...very disappointed.Update: there is no adhesive on the back! What a ripoff!"
"I ordered 2 stamps and 2 ink pads, they sent 2 stamps and 1 ink pad. They said the “order appears correct, that’s what you’ve received” nothing like terrible customer service. The stamps are crappy, not cut right, give your money to another company."
"I bought this for my son for Christmas and he loves it. He is 16, 6' and 160lbs. Athletic build and the medium fit perfectly. He usually wears a large in men's but being a hoodie I tried the medium. Fit perfectly and the quality is great."
We love this little utility cart and it has already been put to use in a bathroom as it it perfect for holding extra towelsand other needs.It was simple to assemble and it appears to be quite sturdy.Very please with the way it looks and functions.
These arrived in good order and were not broken.  One was taken out and sampled and the consensus from everyone  was that tit tasted like wafer crackers from communion and that they would definitely taste better with icing and not plain.
"As an avid walker for fitness and health, I was dismayed to have a plantar fascitis flare up.  I inserted the heel cup into my favorite walking shoes, and the problem was greatly minimized; it allowed for quicker healing."
This does not look like the main picture.  It is dull and has no contrast.  In person it looks like the third picture in the advertisement and does not look like it fits in its present price point.  I sent it back.
"I expected this to be what the hygienist at the dentist uses, but I was disappointed.  It had more the consistency of ordinary toothpaste with some grit added, so it did not stay on the polishing head or toothbrush very well.  Not thick enough to be very effective."
"Got this for my 9 year old daughter.  Fit is good, easy to adjust and she likes them well both in the fresh water lake, ocean or swimming pool.  Good anti-fog too, right out of the box but time will tell.  Definitely recommended and would buy again."
"Typically excellent Victorinox quality.  Just purchased recently. This is a very large multifunction sport watch, and I expect the long-term performance to be excellent. Only minor complaint is that the light green hands can be difficult to read against the silver dial especially in daylight sun."
"Its messy if you don't know what you are doing. Its also difficult to find. Thats the minus part. I use it as a back up. If you need an overhaul clean up, use it  and avoid getting it everywhere."
These planners are great for home or business use.  Lots of area to write notes and record appointments.  I love these and have bought one every year for the last five years.  A great price compared to other planners.  Very sturdy construction and well thought out.
Shoe size fits my child’s foot but getting the heal into the boot is hard.  I have to undo the laces every time my child wants to wear them.  Boots look great and once they are on they are fine.  But getting them on is challenging.
"Arrived in a bubble mailer broken in half.  Not really the type to return things so a little dab of glue in a couple places and good as new.  Very delicate piece, may wish to mail in a more sturdy package."
"My HP 2200 died, so I purchased a rebuilt one at a great price.  So far, it works great - a little more noisy than my other one, but it works fine.  So far, I am very pleased."
"I am 5'7'', 195lbs. The XL fit true to size, about 2"" above my ankles. It is gathered to look like a pleated skirt but is more relaxed. Very light material but not see through. The red is absolutely gorgeous! Will purchase more!"
I did have to return them because they didn't fit (my fault) but Snaptin has been great. When a dog ate my first drone I ordered a new one came next day. When I had questions about my drone they answered the next day. Very customer friendly company.
I bought this so my Lhasa Apso could look out the window.This condo was super easy to assemble and it is very sturdy. Sturdy enough for my 20 pound dog to hop on and off of and she likes to hides treats and toys in the bottom cubby.
"Very cute. My son missed Pre-K graduation due to Covid, and since I was also graduating college, I wanted to do something special. Now I have pictures to look back on with love. Great quality, and the fit was as expected."
"These refills (if that's a fair description) are terrible. You can tell by the feel vs. a refill that will last. Very light and flimsy. I have gone through two in less than a month. My original lasted over five months.These are pathetic, and should be removed from Amazon."
"Bought to use in my car, it's 12vdc. I like the size and seems like a pretty legit filter element. Just what I needed! Would be cool if it came with a car adapter but can't complain for the price. I'll just make one."
My son wanted Arvy for longest and they have been so expensive. I get it because there arent many around turns into collector item.Not sure about quality of the product due to many plastic around. Hope it lasts long as other diecast metal cars
"We were excited that the nose and earplugs came in their own little cases. However, the quality of the nose plugs is terrible. 4 of the 6 pairs broke within the first 3 uses. They don’t flex enough for taking on and off. Really bummed about these."
"Bought this to hold graded coins in PCGS or NCG holders, and while they do fit, there is a little too much room. The product with 12 pockets instead of 9 is slightly too small however... just have to make due!"
"The Zebra Mildliners are so gorgeous! The colors are really beautiful, and you can write right on top without the two inks bleeding together. If you do any crafting or just like to dress your notes up, these are perfect for adding a little spice to otherwise dull writing."
"Definitely a comfortable dress to wear around on a hot summer day.  I only wish Coolibar would make this dress in less matronly colors.  Can we get a pink, coral, white, or something of the likes?!?  (If you want a looser fit, size up.)"
I bought this for my ARRMA Granite BLX knowing I would have to mess with it a bit. Honestly it fits pretty well with some creativity. I cleaned the chassis with alcohol before applying the adhesive and it stuck just fine.
"I am a 34DD I ordered the S/M and yes it fit but it offers zero support. My jugs just slide around inside this bra.  The back is super cute, so I am very disappointed that it can't contain my girls."
I love this calendar and purchase it every year. The quality of the printing is beautiful. It also comes with a nice Moon Watcher Guide which contains lots of interesting astronomical information. It is fun for the whole family to learn about the moon.
I bought this for my fifteen year old and she loves it.  It looks great with leggings.  Very well made for the price.  We received it about a month sooner than the estimated arrival date which really sweetened the deal!
"At first I hesitated due to price. But after having one, I can’t imagine doing without. It totally changed my trips into the plant with drawings. Now, I pretty much carry it everywhere I go. I’m surprised one of my coworkers hasn’t tried to swipe it from me!"
"Dress is pretty, not exactly like picture, but quality is good and looks ok. I expected more to be like on the picture, style is not the same, this dress is following body shape, and it doesn't have straight line, but anyway looks good."
I installed a set of these color toners in my Oki printer 2 months ago & so far they're all working perfectly. All installed without a hitch & the colors are very close to what the Oki toners were putting out. I would buy these again.
We used this at an elementary school for the Chinese New Year holiday they were perfect and made the school look very festive. They are made of good quality and can be used again . Would recommend to anyone looking to spruce up their holiday .
"I bought this for running in cold weather ,,and wear it as a base layer ,,the sizing is perfect ,I got the large and it fits good .,same as ascis ..adidas ..Under armour.the breathability is great,,the warmth is not ,,but Its not a problem as a base layer ."
Very cute avocado outfit but some loose threads and runs small. I ordered a size up from what daughter is wearing now hoping to give her some room to wiggles but and it was almost too tight. So definitely size up
"I love these collars because they come with a place to hook an ID badge for your dog. Unfortunately mine came with a leash ring that had some finishing issues. Instead of the stainless steel looking finish, it seems flaky and rusty."
"The product is good.  The packing, not so good.  The original cellophane wrapper had popped open, so they put it in a fitted plastic bag to hold it all together for shipping.  At least it didn't break open enroute."
I bought this so when my neighbors dogs start to bark.  I was under the impression that humans couldn't hear it.  But I could hear this whistle no matter what I done to it. It never bothered the dogs.
"I love this wallet, its my second 1 and not my last. My first 1 I had 3 years and iys still usable but I broke the zipper.  Not because of the product because I'm a mom of a 4yr old lol. Can't get enough of them."
I ordered a 38 D. I wear this size in most bras I've tried DD and that size is too big not even a close call. This is definitely not a size D. It squished my boobs out the sides.
Really cheap for the quality. Really nice with your teeth. Not too harsh on your gums and hard enough to clean all the impurities. The best part is that you can through it away into your compost bin and it will decompose!
"Exactly what I needed. A little flimsy but, I expected it to be a little cheap because it was cheap. I used it for a bunny cage and it's perfect, I bought same product from another seller and both seem to fit together and work well"
"It works fast, makes it easier to target problem areas. Smells good very faint coconut.  I dont think its to greasy like some of the other comments say. I mean its a sweat gel not lotion...... love it will be purchasing more. Thank you Honeybull fit gel"
"Really happy to get this for my kids, they are loving it. Keeps them engaged for a long time so I liked it too. Quality is good and well made. It comes with a lot of items (markers, chalk, 2 magnetic rulers, magnetic alphabets and numbers). Totally worth its money."
"The lenses seems like a great quality lense. Two small things, you can see through them and see your eyes ( no big deal) and their is a reflection on the inside and that can be kind of annoying at times."
"The most adorable dress! The skirt poof is just right, it fits well, seems to be well made, and has great color! We all loved it - including the strong willed 3 year old! She wore it MULTIPLE times without any fuss!"
"I definitely recommend! They are so pretty, the pictures didn't do them justice. They are also true to size, mine are a half of an inch.Also the top two cartilage studs were a gift! Thank you so much there perfect and I love them! Will be buying from them again."
"Out of a set of 5, 2 had some rather sharp wires that were uncomfortable.Easily fixed by adding dots of glue to the wire ends.I was tempted to remove 2 stars for that.  But the scalp-massaging sensation feels surprisingly good, so I give it 4 stars overall."
Sprayer is a nice powerful mist. Product working well to keep hard water deposits from forming on new tile/grout shower. Slight odor like clr but only about an 1/8 of the strong scent-dissipates quickly. I spray it once a week.
"Thin material, but it's a bathing suit so you want it to be thin to dry quick. It's really cute. I'm 5'4, 36D, 145lbs, fits great. I thought the tiny butt piece wouldnt cover my donk, but it did. I love it. Cant beat it for the price."
It has a TERRIBLE odor that will not go away.  I have had it for about 2 weeks and have sprayed the interior with fabreze odor eliminator for fabric and used leather cleaner on the outside and let it air out outside for 3 days and it still smells;(
This guy is beautiful. A must have for any godzilla collector. If you like Rodan you'll love getting Fire Rodan. SH Monsterarts has made an outstanding figure here. I'm just waiting for the day they make a Titanosaurus and Megalon....come on SH Monsterarts make it happen.
Amazing fit. I am currently a breast feeding mother so I needed something that wasn't too restricting that also gave me a little lift. Perfect fit. There wasn't any weird overhang or riding up and it was still comfy while it made my boobs look great!
"Not the best clips, but haven't found any I particularly like on this type of cage, it does keep the animal from escaping which is the point. You should not pick up the cage from the top anyway, always support the bottom."
"I love the vehicle,  the only thing I wished the instructors were written and not just pictures...that caused a lot of guessing and trying. Other than that I recommend this purchase. I bought for my dogsvto have fun ."
Perfectly fits two epi pen jr. inside but I wish there was a little more room for Benadryl and histamine cream. But I bought one of those little Benadryl bottles so I hope that will work. But bag is great.
At first i thought that this wasnt goin to be useful but i was wrong. Its way better than a mop and for me that i used to use a cleaning rag with a broom its also a great improvement.
I know these are simple boxes but I like their sturdiness and their uniformity. I was able to store sleeved bubble gum cards with just the right amount of room as to not crush the sleeves or the corners of the cards.
Bill loves it but it gives him dreadful gas and it smells funky but I expected that because of the ingredients. It does not break him out and I feel it is added nutrition for an old but spunky french bulldog.
"I have purchased  your basic normal ink cartridges for years and I was amazed at the difference in quality using the high-yield high-resolution Lexmark cartridges. I'm afraid they have spoiled me now. I highly recommend them, very much worth the price."
"Super thick when stirred with almond milk; thick and frothy when blended with almond milk. Tastes much better than other protein powders I've had and has little bits of crunchy &#34;cookie dough&#34; which I actually enjoy, but are more like malt balls like cookie dough."
Love my mask and I can breathe through it unlike some others I have ordered. I wish it came with a filter pocket but I’ll fix that myself. I wore it for Labor Day weekend and many people liked it and asked where I purchased it.
"Well, it happened.  Tonight, my dog had an accident on the bed - the whole reason I bought this, and the blanket is in no way waterproof.  I washed it on delicate and dried on low upon receipt.  The material is quite stiff."
"These aquarium plants were much better than I expected. They are great foreground plants or anywhere you want to fill in some space on the substrate. The price was right. This is exactly what I needed to make my aquarium look complete,"
Self sealing left window envelopes are great for sending out work related letters.  They seal enough to keep several pages in yet can be opened without cheering to add something to the envelope. Self sealing envelopes increase speed of placing information in the envelopes.
"The spray works well and the bags and packets do a great service to keeping the little critters away,  as long as I do my part and not store foodstuffs to tempt them. I was a skeptical person but it WORKS."
This product came so quickly! And it is really great colors. My kids loved getting it for Christmas. It keeps the baby busy long enough for me to complete tasks for my job. I’m definitely going to recommend it to my friends!
I found the sleeves to be a little tight on this top.  I also found the material to not be forgiving if you have any bumps or bulges on  your body.  It was just not flattering to someone who is a little overweight.
"Great value! This is a massive amount for just our 1 lonely goldfish. After reading directions,  he needs just a drop added to water during tank clean out and partial changes. Smells good, like tea tree. And solution is totally clear without any cloudiness."
It looked great when I got it. But 8 months later you can barely read it. The camera makes it look much more readable than it actually is. It rarely gets direct sun but has faded to where it is almost unreadable at this time.
"These are good boxes, the thickness of the cardboard is a bit minimal (single wall), so if you're shipping something light, like 15 to 20 lbs or less they are fine.  For the price, the are a good deal."
"This item has relieved the problem of holding my arm/wrist in the correct position on the mouse pad as I work. Now, I can relax and pay more attention to my work and have less muscular tension in the arm/shoulder/neck. My work day is better."
"Full sized Wall File. Measure first but it will hold an office full of paperwork and is fast and easy to install. I didn't measure the length and expected something smaller, it's perfect for what I need, but I was surprised. Just a few minutes to install and very sturdy."
This was a gift for my 4 year-old great grandson.  He totally loved it.  It fits in his little hands beautifully and he just can't get enough of it's repeating what he says.  Plus the cute little robot sounds are fun.
Ordered these for my 3 year old to wear with dress up. Didnt expect them to last forever but did expect them to last longer than 3 days. The sparkles literally peeled away and the shoe detached from the sole.
"item was shipped very promptly, 2 days. packaged well. not as described. Lining was described as shearling, white wool, this lining is a fuzzy man-made stuff that looks like a carnival toy. the leather is not as pictured, more like 1970's pimp-wear. overall, not impressed."
"this pencil is very ergonomic. I got both the aluminum and this one. I love the short handle, it is very easy to use and the lead is thick enough to shade with. The quality of both the composite and the aluminum is well made."
"Looks great and well constructed. The reason I did not give it 5 stars — I would have liked a little note card or a place to write on, instead of writing directly on the face of the popup card. Many companies are providing that, now."
I use my printer for printing full color book covers and charts. These cartridges appear to be the same quality as OEM cartridges for a fraction of the cost. Have ordered these a couple of times and am very pleased with my purchases.
This product is magic. My husband was battling for a year with a stye eye. We bought everything possible to get rid of the stye but nothing worked like this product. The tickness is just perfect a little bit goes along the way. We highly highly recommend it.
So happy I have this for that time of the month. My cramps get really bad and heat is a life saver.  And its portable.  Not that I move much with it on. Makes me feel comfortable enough to fall asleep.  Great buy
"Really?  This shows that four came with the order, I only received three....  I have given two away to fellow No Maskers and I love mine.  No hassle in entering any store (so far) or while in the store..  Recommend purchase..."
"I had these when I was a child, I decided to get them to show my granddaughter and she loves trying to get them apart and it keeps her busy and off of computers, tablets or watching for a little while"
"This game was the hit at our Christmas family get-together. People from 12 to 72 were playing and everyone was having fun. The pieces seem to be well made.  I would recommend this game for anyone. And as a bonus, the price is half of very similar games."
I was expecting that the box would be much larger. I purchased this for a gift for my son's friend and the box is so small it looks like a &#34;cheap&#34; gift. Luckily I ordered a lego chima lunch box to go with it.
"I bought to keep odd shaped scratch paper.  Nice by a chair for so many everything’s…grocery lists. Phone #s, To Do Lists, etc.  Not so big that it’s in the way but solid surface.  Also. Not  so big it gets cluttered. Thanks"
"This stuff is the real deal, seriously. From your daily diaper cream, to applying it to areas that are red or sensitive.. this stuff is pricy, but it works. Will not switch to a different balm.. this is my go to!"
"The EBY Compatible Toner Cartridge Replacement for Brother is an excellent product. My concern for quality at an incredibly low price was completely resolved. Image is sharp, solid black, and the life of the toner is impressive. I'll buy it again."
Been using this for two years love it ! Works great perfect amount of tea tree got at the store for $3  keeps my lips from clapping got for my dad who gets cold sores and he loves it also !
"The little dog comes as pictured and described, will be a stuffy for my teenage daugher. The eyes are sewn which is great to avoid falling out. It did come vacuum sealed so it’s a little smooshed and crooked and requires some massaging to get it fluffed back to normal."
"Bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it. She needs the fidget, sensory products. It has long enough straps on it for it to be a crossbody bag. My granddaughter puts her IPad inside of it. The price was really reasonable. Please with this purchase."
"Looked up and compared options and settled with this 2 in one tool. Very happy with it and our dog seems to enjoy the dematting blade thing, which detangles his fur enough for the comb side to work as the second step."
Perfect travel size dominos! Bought 2 of these. All dominos are there & correct unlike another review I saw. Recommend you put a rubber band around the case as the lid is not tight fitting. I could easily see it popping off if in a bag or suitcase.
"I underestimated the power of this little tool. Once I got the hang of using it, it's a great addition to my personal hygiene routine. The power behind this little thang beats regular floss by far. It will be hard to go back. Nice Product!"
"These are not for everyday use. I bought a heavy duty keychain for my kids backpacks, but these work fine for day trips to crowded places. The air tag can easily pop out from the rubber if your child plays too hard."
I love that these come in a pack of multiple. My cats adore their water fountain and refuse to drink from anything else now! It is their favorite thing!! And these just help keep their favorite thing clean and filtered properly.
"Nice quality square crafting paper that is the perfect size for folding around my business catalogs for mailing. I can securely add a nail application kit (cello bag with wrap sample, cuticle scissors, nail file, orange stick) and my recipients tell me everything arrives intact and in  perfect condition!"
I purchased this for my mom because our freestyle Libre sensors kept falling off in this Southern heat! She loves them especially because she grows roses or did until she became ill and couldn’t do it anymore so now she said she wearing her roses!
My dogs love them so I assume the flavor is great. They are soft-pressed jerky that comes in a flat stick. I break the stick up into small pieces because they are rather pricey. They devour it in no time. Best of all…they are made in the USA!
"Nice, quality feeling brush.  Bristles are real badger and keep their softness after being used and rinsed.  Wood is solid and light, good handle shape for control while lathering and applying shave soap.  Overall very pleased with the product. Price feels a little high."
Terrible quality and I regret purchasing them so much. I've had them a couple weeks but only just put one in. After 3 whole days my skin is turning GREEN and the design broke already. Absolutely garbage do not buy
Upon receiving the talking bible for my father-in-law of whom wanted this for Christmas. He loves the bible. He can't see very well to read. So the bible reads to him an he loves it he plays it everyday. I would recommend this product to anyone..
"I buy one every year, love the artwork sooo much, I save my favorites each year and May end up framing. The calendar paper is very sturdy and thicker than most, even has a metal eyelet to hang by so nothing could ever rip. Beautiful calendar in my kitchen😊"
"I guess I should have paid more attention to the ""thin"" description.  My little Chi mix can devour one of these in minutes and he's a 9 lb dog.  They also smell worse than any other bully sticks I've ever purchased."
Yesss!!! Finally a high quality remanufactured ink that actually works!! All of them worked! Not just one! Great price too! I will be a repeat customer as long as they keep making these and I’ve got the same printer that takes these otherwise expensive cartridges.
"Wanted to love this, the price is right, it’s no flimsy and has some weight to it. But the nubs are filed down to smoothly. It doesn’t actually scratch your back for you. Doesn’t grip your skin enough to actually be used as a back scratcher"
I bought the beard straightener for a Christmas gift. Now my husband doesn't know how he ever lived without it. It tames all his fly away hairs! I think overall this is better than anything I have ever bought to tame the beard.
"For the price it’s not terrible. Bought it for my 3 year old. It is meant I think for a few years older, the button layout/programming is not great. It lasts about 20 minutes before it needs to be recharged for hours."
"I bought these to move from Illinois to Florida. They were great and an awesome value compared to the major stores.  No broken plates or dishes.--being big we used the foam pouches for plates, glass bowels, vases any thing fragile.  Big time saver!!!!"
"Good price but in the description it says it comes with bags, tags and tissue. I got the bags and tags but no tissue. Didnt go out and buy tissue cause I thought this was suppose to come with it. A little disappointed."
"I ordered this for my baby shower, it was really cute stuff. I ended up not having but a couple people show up to my shower so it was plenty. However my sons nursery was already done in fish and anchors so I used it for decorations in his room."
I have so many laptop bags and purses that I rotate through while traveling.  I want to make sure I am grabbing something that is mine alone.  So far these guys have been quite sturdy for the last month on 20+ flights!!
"I have to say that you can NOT look at the picture when ordering this!  It only includes the top item.  While I did, however, like the durability of the bone, I was disappointed that I didn't read more carefully.  The add should have been more clear!"
I am confused as to what these wraps are suppose to do for you....where is the arch support??  I tried two sizes and neither fit me well so I returned them...was really hoping for some relief of my plantar fasciitis but...
"While these are super cute, I wanted the buyer to be aware that they are also fragile.  I purchased two of them, one for each mom for Mother's Day.  The first one snapped the chain within one wearing and the second had the charm come off."
We needed a space to keep pencils and a ruler easily accessible for our homeschooling 3rd grader. She uses a tiny basic desk and we wanted to avoid top clutter and where glad to find this under desk drawer that has worked perfectly.
"If you can keep them in your ears, they work well, but if you have any ear wax or moisture, coating your ear canal, they tend to expand and slide out. I found it hard to keep them in. I have better results with the 3M ear plugs."
"i went on a trip with several friends and to commemorate our friendship we all picked one pin, now we always have something to remember how great the times we spent with eachother are. these are super sturdy high quality pins at a great value."
Very comfortable. Beautiful style and easy to adjust your straps. The adjustable straps are in the front so it’s easy to ware. Would recommend to anyone. Great value for the money. I’ve made viola bra’s my personal favorite. I would recommend the comfort over all!
Love this dress!  Reminds me of the same dress Miranda is wearing in her video &#34;Vice&#34;.  Wearing it with black cowboy boots and a tan leather jacket.  Fits as expected so follow the size chart provided.  Can be dressed up or down.
"These are fun inexpensive socks. I would have given them a higher review, but as I put on the first pair they practically ripped in two. The rest were fine, but I was a little leery after the initial tear."
Such a cute tree! I was unable to get the fold creases out so I had to tape it flat against my wall. It worked but I wish I hadn’t of had to tape it at all. Am I asking too much?
These kits are so great for the beginner sewer. My 9 year old LOVES them. She sews most of it on our sewing machine but still gets some experience with hand stitching when necessary. I recommend these kits for new sewers but experienced sewers will enjoy them too.
Comes flat packed smooshed but as soon as you take it out and fluff it a little he perks right up.  Very soft.  No odor at all. Overall about the size of a regulation football (but cuter and softer!)  We caught grandma kissing his nose. .. twice.
"Purchased for 3yr old granddaughter and she is going to go bonkers over this. It's so well made, substantial in weight, full of sparkle, and as cute as can be. Came in a very nice box too. Will absolutely buy from this line again. Thank you"
"I like the bags, the only thing I don’t like is finding the tabs to pull up when closing the bag, it’s all the same color red and I have to search for the tabs to close the bag, otherwise happy with them."
I used to make banners using this paper all the time for personal and professional use. Most machines today do not accept this paper and the job orders banners when/as needed. It was my go to in its glory days.
Once you download the template for these labels its super easy to pop in your text or image and print.  They don't get jammed up in my printer and the ink looks nice on them.  Have good stickiness and staying power.
Love this automatic fish feeder.. Its very easy to set up. It can feed ur fish up to 4 times. It has a button for manual feeding if want to feed them urself. Overall this is a great product and it keeps my fish well feed.
These have a lot of sponge and so it could be too much for your shoes if you only have a small void to fill.  They have a rough surface rather than smooth and come in 3 different thicknesses.
"To be honest, I bought this to use as a coaster for a pitcher of tea or lemonade set in the middle of the table for a meal. It does of corse make a lovely mouse pad, but it’s pretty on my table for my off label usage lol."
I started buying DreamBone products because my dog has a sensitive stomach.  DreamBones are easy for her to digest.  She enjoys them.  I feel that DreamBone has quality products and would recommend them to pet owners that really care what their dog eats.
"I have been purchasing this same product for at least 15 years or more.It is perfect for me as a journal, that I enjoy writing in every evening.The way this is set up it is perfect as a journaling book."
"I'm thinking of buying one of these to monitor my salinity and ph.. is there anyone that bought this item, still has it working, and can give any input on performance and accuracy? I've herd theyre not reliable or accurate.  Thanks in advance for your time and help!"
"I wanted to add some color to my tank, rather than just having all green faux plants. This looks really great, the only issue is that the lighting on top of my tank has made the top of this fade to almost a pale red."
If you are going to get something choose the eyelash curler that is heated. That one actually works! It looks like a curling lash and you heatit and about 20 - 30 second put it it on your eyelid and close. Hold there for about 8-10 seconds and done!
"I really like the style and feel of this sweater.l  It's not your high end yarn, so I would hand wash only.  I am ordering another color-really cute and not bulky as the arms are not lined which I like."
"I found no arch support at all.  The insole is absolutely flat, and has not a bit of flexibility anywhere.  They made my feet hurt, and I couldn't walk in them for any length of time.  I was terribly disappointed and I am returning them."
"Beautiful!  Lang calendars are outstanding quality, and most are beautiful.  They have plenty to choose from in a variety of styles.  I have two Lang frames, so I order two calendars each year.  This will go in my home office."
The idea was great. I have very thick corse eyelash blades (I am Hispanic). This didn’t even come close to curling them. I was so disappointed. I tried multiple different ways. If you have thin eyelash blades it would probably work
Perfect. I bought this to carry fertility medication in to and from work when I needed it. I’m using to transport breast milk to/from the NICU a year later. It’s just the right size and keeps stuff that requires refrigeration cool enough.
"Two of the four boards ordered were a little bit warped by dings to the surface and they don't stick as well to door surface. Aside from slight shipping damage, they were a good deal for decent quality. Good marker quality."
I had free samples. It smelt like coffee & tastes like coffee. The flavor was good. The aftertaste is overpowering. I put the second sample in my Coca-Cola & the coffee flavor overpowered it. It did give me a weak energy kick.
"I was looking for a more affordable version of the canon gloss paper, and this is a good substitute. Nice weight and good gloss shine. My prints come out slightly darker on this paper than on the Canon, which I actually prefer."
"we use it on our patio and lawn.  Our  80 pound greyhound is a nester and has destroyed many a blanket.This is a good quality, goes back in it's carrying bag easily and is soft.  Somewhat like the top of a sleeping bag."
"This is cute, funny, comfy and blends in with nice furniture. Doggie likes it, and snoozes on it. Tip: At first, bait it with a few treats shoved into the cushions. They catch on quickly. Also adorable for toddlers and kiddos up to 35 pounds."
Super speedy delivery.  Great if you want a cheap looking printed key ring. You get a white plastic black print key ring.  I'm going to find a dog tag engraving machine for something that looks nicer. This looks like it's worth $3 at most.
My son tried the tire thing before and can't really move his arm to swim.  The Super Swimr works perfectly as described.  I will recommend it to all beginners.  They should make one for older children and adults who can't swim.
"This pet bed is both enormously hilarious and just plain enormous.  Don't look at the measurements and think, &#34;yeah, I know how big that is,&#34; because you probably don't.  (Or at least, I didn't.)  Despite that, this banana bed is awesome, especially for the price."
These are fantastic! My dog loves them and I feel good giving them to him because the ingredients are real food and are good for him. It's not that easy to find great healthy dog treats. These are the best I've found and my dog give them 5 paws up.
It made my lashes curl up and look so plush without pinching or pulling. I usually lose eyelashes now I can focus on regrowing them. It heated quickly and the heat shield means you can put the wand away and leave when you're done! I just love it!
"This did not slow my dog down. I cleaned his stainless steel bowl to attach, and after a few days the suctions quit sticking. It is not easy to clean, and it is not durable. I will be returning and getting a hard surface slow feeder instead."
"I ended up returning the skirt.  It looks like a nice skirt in the photos, but when I received it...I returned it.  Material is flimsy and cheap looking, and the pattern is not as nice looking up close."
"I saw previous reviews about the sizes running small, so I ordered a size up. The size we ordered was for 8-9years, which should be a M/L, but it is a size S. I would order at least 2 or 3 sizes up from what you would expect."
"Thick t shirt material. Not sweatshirt, like I expected. I love how the “sleeves fall. They are comfortable. Only really complaint is that the hood on one of the two shirts I bought is not centered and messes with my OCD."
"This item was as described, easy to assemble,  and has started our year off more organized than previous years.  While it has not had any issues with stability,  I would prefer the extra confidence that locking tabs would provide."
This LED night light is very useful since it stays when it is plugged in which is good and bad.  The LED bulb lasts a very long time therefore the light is not as bright as the other night lights that uses a regular light bulb.
"These are really good for anyone who is into magic and card magic. There is not much easy or intermediate level stuff you can do with these, but if you know card magic, these would be really good to buy."
"These glasses significantly reduce the glare and eye strain and help me with my migraines since I've started using these I've had much less eye strain and have been more productive at work, I highly recommend these glasses if you work in front of the computer screen."
My 13 year old is obsessed with all things BBC and sci fi so this calendar was a great find. Nice heavy paper and great selection of images from BBC's  Sherlock. Maybe this will hold them over until Hobbit & Trek come out!
"It's just okay. A spot of color worn of the front of the door. The draw at the bottom does stick but can be opened. The hangers are really thin and cheap looking. The little 7 year old girl loves, which is all that matters."
"This product blended well into the tea full of healthy additives that I sip on throughout the day. The taste didn't overpower the drink with all its additions, and the powder mixed in just fine. I hope it will help me be more healthy. I'm happy with it."
Awesome watch rotator. I can place 2 watch in at a time and it works well. It comes with a power adapter and I believe it's made of wood. It's easy to clean and also easy to use. I recommend this to everyone.
I had to go back to college school at the age of 60 and this has greatly helped me keep my mind clear and always alert. The effect has been felt from day one and gradually improves. I recommend 100 %
I ordered grey but it is most definitely not grey. It’s brown. I like this dress though so I’ll keep it and I’ll probably order other colors! I’m normally a small so I ordered a small but it is just a tad big.
"I bought a pair of these ""Magnetic Massage Foot Therapy Reflexology Pain Relief Shoe Insoles"". Dumbest purchase I've made in a long time. They didn't help a bit and were expensive. My advice?  Talk to a qualified health care provider before you spend your money."
Don't Spend the money unless you want to look like a Hippo in a tutu!  Very cheaply made thin material and don't even think about returning for a refund unless you want to pay for shipping to the UK.
"Beautiful craftsmanship.  Top quality, but I couldn’t get it to write smoothly.  I tried several cartridges, but could never get it to write consistently. I would purchase this item again if I could figure out what ink cartridge would work well with it."
Dress is beautiful and well made. A little small but I am exchanging it for a bigger size. Worth the price & the make of the dress. Pleasantly surprised by the overall quality. Dress was one of my Mom's 1st online dresses. She loves it! So pretty! :)
I can't think of a reason not to give Ghost Rider 5 stars. The attention to detail is amazing. The costume fits perfectly and captures the essence of Ghost Rider. Any fan of Ghost Rider or a collector of RAH will be pleased.
"This is the only tech tool I’ve bought that I’ve hooked immediately up and it worked perfectly! I connected it straight to my Promethean, and I can project workbook pages or student work directly on to the board. No software and no computer needed to get it up and running."
I loved this!! Super cute. I got a large or medium and the bottoms were great but the top was a little big. Idk if that's the swimsuits fault though. I just put two safety pins in it and boom! Favorite swimsuit
"Maybe I misread the description measurements but I thought this figure was the same size as our other Avengers but he is shorter and not to the same scale, so he looks out of place in our superhero melees. Good rendering though."
A friend recommended I try this tea at the first sign of a cold. I was glad I did. This tea gave me relief with the cold symptoms. I will make sure I always have some of this tea on hand.
"I only received 3 sheets of these sticker not the 5 that was supposed to in package. I didn't say anything because I dont own a slew of electronic devices, but I would make you receive all 5 sheets in your order."
"Should have paid more attention to search results. Was searching for a slatwall holder.  The holder is great - it just isn't made for slatwall.  We've made it work, but it really wasn't what I was looking for."
"I got a good bargain for this product. I wish my animals weren’t so particular about the variety. They pick and choose – mainly the pellets, leaving the other parts. I hate to waste it, so I threw the remainder out for the birds!"
"Ordered the I'd badges to make name cards for our church senior group. I received what I expected and they worked fine. They came as Expected in the time advertised. When we need more, I will order the same. Thanks."
"The banner is cute but not worth the money to have to provide your own string, thread it yourself by your own ingenuity and the heart banner was half the size it advertises it as. I would pay $4 for this, not $10 or whatever they charged."
I like that it comes apart if I want and stores stuff.  It seems to be lasting ok with  my big boy using it.  It won't be forever since it is like a really sturdy cardboard inside.
My wife reports her Headbands fits exceptionally well. Nice and snug and very comfortable. She says they never come loose during yoga and she likes the way they look. She has had  compliments on them as well. Great product. Would definitely recommend
"These are a great value for the money and perfect for my budding artist. He is so picky about which pencils he uses for which projects so I loved the variety. He has not used the colored ones yet, to my knowledge."
They are nice but the clips are too tight and they are not glued on the greatest. You can tell where they glued on some and see the backing. Can’t fit on a sweater collar because the clips are too tight.
The only drawback is it is not very ergonomic for me.  The scoop handle has too much of an angle.  I put my foot in the scoop and bent the handle forward so it was more straight over the scoop.
"I totally forgot I bought this until it showed up. It does a terrible job of keeping dog food contained and leads to a huge mess. HOWEVER, if you smudge some peanut butter throughout it, you'll have a pups entertained for many many hours."
Cleanse Detox Tea Caps is my daily supplement intake. It's a natural way to flush out toxins and aid digestion. It states on the bottle that you will see results in 3 days and I have. I have seen a change in my appetite and eating habits. Highly recommend.
"It is awesome that this product has been created and that it has helped many people. Sadly, it didn't help me. All it did was cause anxiety. It feels like constant electric shocks going into my hand. I got no relief from my nasea."
I bought these baby llamas to put on top of a baby gift.  They look exactly like they do in the photo and made an adorable decoration for the package.  The baby as it gets older will have 2 cute stuffed animals to play with.
"The engraving on both the box and the pen looked beautiful and the box/pen set is a really nice quality. The person to whom I gave it absolutely loved it, definitely would buy again. Shipping was also very fast, especially for a personalized product."
"I bought one for each of my grandsons. One is 8 years, 2 are 7 years & one is 5 years.  They love this.  They play with the gun without the target sometimes.  They really have a lot of fun with this."
Who doesn't want a big diamond ring! The rings came before expected and looked better than the picture. I put these rings in goody bags and the girls loved them! Worth the purchase. I am happy with this company and would order from them again.
"I, too, bought the three pack at Costco. I had never seen my dog destroy a plush toy until she got her teeth into one of these &#34;indestructible&#34; toys. I just found her pulling the stuffing out of the mongoose's snout."
"I love this protein, tastes great and can be used as a supplement or a meal replacement. I've been using it for about 8 months now and it has helped me lose weight along with exercise. I stay full for a good 3-4 hours too."
"Love the size and the colors! Was hoping it would be a bit thicker but it's ok. Sewn edging is soft and not scratchy. Has a rubber smell, just like a mousepad would, but it will diminish when it airs out. And LOVE the little bonus matching coaster!"
"LOVE these shorts around the house. They are extremely comfy and cute, however they are extremely short so only wear them indoors haha! Also, air dry them because they will shrink even more in the dryer. Besides the length, I love these shorts!"
"This product is a great concept but… after a few months, the bottom clear plastic part that you slip in an id started to split and rip. Not sure why this could had happened other than me trying to wipe the inside of it lightly due to “teaching debris “"
These are funky and interesting. Fits so far over any of my shoes lol. Seems durable. I would just have to wait in see to actually try them out in rain or snow... Maybe then I'll provide the quality of them.
These pills do have a slight vomit spell but do not have any taste.  You'll need to wash your  hands as the smell stays on them.  I personally didn't have any problem with them.  I use these as a  prebiotic. I took 2 a day.
"Makes great gifts, very affordable, beautiful presentation in the box and wrapping.  I took this as a gift to one of my friends baby showers and my best friend won. I got to use one of them and it was amazing."
"Love it!!!  It powers my Dometic CFX40 easily, for days. And it charges very quickly on the100w solar panel. I like being able to see what’s being input and output. And i love that I can pick it up and move it around."
I’m all about flowy dresses but this felt like a frumpy bag lady dress. Nothing about it feels as though it fits and therefore it adds pounds to your appearance and looks like a muumuu (even though I’m all about comfort.)
Love this trailer.  Got it for my old labrador for when she gets tired of running alongside my bike.  She's 84 pounds and all I had to do was put a dog bed in it to cart bet big butt home!
I LOVE this stuff. First it’s natural- very important to me for anything I use on my fur baby.  Serving the smell is AMAZING!  I’m sensitive to fragrances- this is pleasant and mild but good scent.  Highly recommend.
"Clippers snagged almost every time - I feel it has something to do with the plastic components on the grooming sheers, instead of metal. Clippers snag every time on hair. My dog *hates* when I pull these things out even with bribing her with treats."
Ugg torture. Pieces do not fit snug. 75% are same shape and fit anywhere you want. Pieces are very thin.  Best part is we will be in Venice soon and hope to find the spot we have been staring at for a month.
It’s perfect for my pomeranian. He fits perfectly in it. I use it as a seat for him in my car and he loves it. He snuggles up and falls asleep in it. I also love the color looks like a legit sofa.
These are made of cheap plastic and are fairly hard to get standard tubing to fit.It will fit and these will stop water from siphoning out of the tank if the air pump fails.They are not expensive and get the job done but they just are not the highest quality.
"I had lost the pegs from my set, so I needed new ones. These are a bit more expensive than some of the other ones that are available, but I thought they were totally worth the cost. They look nice and work well with my set."
"These are actually 3.3” x 5.1”.  Which wouldn’t matter except I bought envelopes separately to use with these cards, based on exact measurements of 3x5.  So  the cards are a tiny bit larger than my 3.25 x 5.2 envelopes.  Other than that, the cards are fine."
"Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it.  It is a heavier sweatshirt that fits perfectly.  We've had issues with some Harley ""sweatshirts"" being more like a thicker long sleeved t-shirt, but this is not one of them.  Washes nicely.  You won't be disappointed!"
"Bought these after my cat wouldn't leave my wool dryer balls alone.  Now she has her own set and pulls them out of the toy basket on a regular basis to play with.  They're perfect, and even my other cat who's not as playful enjoys them."
Good product worth it. Got it for my sisters birthday. It was expensive but now looking at the figures I can see why they are good material. Something I wish was different was the little dents on the boxes but the product itself is fine (:
"My 7 yr old has these cute, chubby blocks for feet. These are the only shoes that fit him well. My husband is so upset he can’t have our little sporting Nike’s. Their loss. These shoes are great and durable !"
The product is cute but is much smaller than the dimensions provided. I would not buy from this seller again because it costs $16 to return plus $3 to print out the label at UPS. So I lost time and $19 for this product.
I got this with the impression that it had a magnetic back for the refrigerator. It doesn’t. It also doesn’t clean off very well. I am very disappointed. I will now have to find another one and trash this one. Save your money and buy something else.
I bought this mousepad to use on my work computer.  I have two monitors creating a very widescreen setup.  This mousepad is great for it.  I do not however recommend this for any kind of gaming as the height of the pad will most likely not suffice.
"I thought I was getting more than one! Very expensive, but cute. So far, it works well but for over $8 bucks, thats steep for a small sharpener. I will need to keep them safe as I won’t purchase an expensive sharpener."
"This was EXACTLY what I needed for my business. So far, only one label was damaged. I haven’t used the entire roll. Hopefully, it’s just that 1 damaged sticker in this roll. (It had glue over the wording. Otherwise, perfect for my purpose 👍🏽"
It says they can be purchased in a set of 2 or 4 bpots. As the others say 2 boots and the pack does not. I thought that would be for a set of 4 boots. Well it is only two. Missleading.
That might be true but price is price isn’t. I loved getting my very good ink for a lot less. The color ink is an equal to the original HP 62 color I have bought in the last few years. Thanks Amazon for giving us this option!
"Looking forward to seeing the grandchildren hunt for these fun Easter eggs. I have to admit I have already tried them out and they are very cute, the work well and will make a nice addition to the Easter baskets (as the parents try to limit the sugar intake.)"
This is very nice quality and looks exactly like the picture! I was pretty stoked that they gave an extra text line so we were able to add the name of our property above our names and still had room for the address! I recommend!
Great wallet look and set up. But I was highly disappointed that it doesn't like to stay closed. And I literally have the bare minimal in it. ID. debit card. wic card and a couple dollars. Needs a better latching system.
"I really like these. They have a unique shape, and a wide no slip silicone strip on the heel area. Also has no slip tread on the bottom which is a nice feature. This is a wonderful product at a great price."
"Love these shoes! They do run small, only fit my 4 month old for a week. But, I wasn't sure what size to get him and he is a rather large 4 month old.  I have ordered the next size up because they are cute and versatile."
If your kid is into this Santiago character then he or she will love this little game.  Comes with all the pieces and the instructions are easy to learn and teach to your child.  Makes a fun addition to our family game night
I really wanted to love this set but it falls short of expectations. The print is super cute but the pants are not very soft and unfortunately do not stay up. The sports bra has a different clasp that makes it difficult to fasten.
"I ordered these thinking they were going to be like my other clear plastic folders, which are made of smooth see-though plastic. These folders have textured surfaces—why?! They are also tend to rumple. They look unprofessional. I would not recommend these."
The glasses did not do anything other than give a yellow tint to everything; nothing was in any way clearer. The glasses came with a card that was supposed to show a scene when wearing the glasses. Nothing changed on the card. Definitely not as advertised.
"Perfect for my ticket book and small enough to easily fit in my patrol bag. Only wish it came with a velcro strap to keep the while thing closed. It's not a big deal, but it would be handy to have the velcro."
"The taste is good and it mixes instantly with grit but I haven't noticed anything different pre or post workout after adding this to my routine. Since it's from ALLMAX, I'll just assume it's one of those things that works but you don't notice."
Awesome leash. I was worried about the durability due to the low price. But it is Super strong and comfortable. I only wish I got a longer leash. 6 feet just isn't long enough for my needs all the time. I love it though.
"The entire bone is solid. The  middle of the bone is wrapped in rubber, however, which is fine for teething but takes minutes for powerful chewers to rip apart. Once the rubber is gone, the ends have interesting textures to chew."
The light brown will pick up dirt and show it easier than the dark brown does. The wallet is large and will fit in your back pocket if you cram it in there. I carry mine in my hand or jacket most of the time.
"I wasn’t expecting much from this top but it ended up being SUPER cute! I’ve even washed it twice and it hasn’t fallen apart. For the price, I thought for sure it’d be a one and done but I was wrong… and I’m so happy."
"I didn't know that I'd be receiving three color PCU's, since my order--as well as the printer message--mentioned simply &#34;color PCU&#34;.  I replaced all three, but at least two of them  probably weren't in need of replacement yet.  Shipment was on time and the merchandise was correct."
"Its supposed to be a travel hat, but I've had several and they regain their shape with a little spray of water and stuffing the head with white tissue paper.  I've did this several days ago and repeated it yesterday.  The hat still has unattractive wrinkles."
"Very detailed and awesome figure! Just wish the pieces weren’t so fragile, my biggest complaint is some of the items like the bow don’t fit in her hand. I broke the bow trying to get it to stay, I hope the next nendoroid I order is a little more solid."
"Not great, pretty terrible, but you get what you pay for I guess. The younger granddaughters enjoy them & that’s what matters. If you’re expecting them to look anything like your “Elf on the Shelf” then you’re really going to be disappointed!$!"
"Pros: Bright colors, super soft, decent quality and price, absorbentCons: has a smell when you open the package but it goes away, the bath mat and toilet cover are a good size but the toilet mat is ridiculously laughably small. Like...at least your feet can fit on it."
Perfect fit and color for steps on our playset.  Purchased these railing due to yougner grandchildren using ladder...works great to help so they don't fall while climbing ladder.  Coated with a slip resistant paint that is great as well.
"My daughter uses this with the grotto grip. Using both together is working to teach her to hold per pencil properly. I don't need to remind her to &#34;fix her fingers&#34;. Erasing is tricky, so a separate eraser is a good idea for when mistakes happen."
"VERY pretty diffuser.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it is pretty top heavy.  I've knocked this over more than once just due to the fact the the bottom is very small.  It works exactly as it should, either on or intermittent."
"It’s definitely rubber and not silicone, but boy does it breathe better and feels wonderful.  Great for a classic dive or even rally feelIt definitely is stiffer than similar FKM or NBR rubber straps - but is just as comfortable."
I tried to return the dress and although it says free returns you have to pay to ship it back to China which ends up being almost the same as what the dress costs. The color was brighter than listed and the embellishments on the side are poor quality.
my daughter wears this everyday its cold under her dress. She doesnt fit well in pants because she is tall and skinny so her ankles show. But these are the perfect length and super warm and cozy! she loves it
"Got rid of ich fungus in three days, also work great with pop eye in conjunction with Seachem paraguard. A great multi functional combination for my 19 year old plus saltwater fish only aquarium, 200 gallons +100  refugium and filtration."
"As an avid classic casino game devotee, I loved finding a turnkey solution for my home needs.  Quality components (and just the right size) for my upcoming gatherings with friends and family.  Wish it included a living card dealer too!"
Just the right size for my 10 pound Chihuahua. The wider shoulder strap is much more comfortable that our previous carrier's strap that was about half the width. I wouldn't want to try to carry any larger dog though. Mine just fits comfortably while standing or laying down.
"We really like the ombre look and how the sparkles are flat and not raised. If you are used to leos with rhinestones, this is not as brilliant under the gym lights, but it is very nicely made and comfortable."
Super soft and definitely has good support.  My dog is 55 pounds and it supports her well.  I could have ordered one size smaller and she would still fit nicely . It’s really big and comfortable.  Feels well made
"Terrible concept for a tank. The picture shows three male betas in all their glory, before they die trying to kill each other. The only way this concept might work is if you had three female fish but nobody gets female betas, it's all about those tail fins."
Ithis is a great product ...i wasn't sure at first because of the bubbles but I came to realize that it's was just air release..my boys and I loved spending hot summer Florida days playing in and on this..but it is a chore to put away..that's my only woe...lol
It works just fine. It doesn't leak and it comes with a cover for the tip. I use mine to apply watered down apple cider vinegar directly to my scalp before co-washing my hair to help remove any build up from my scalp.
"Good quality build, and just the right size of Staples for general purpose around the house type stuff. Great for attaching Flyers and things to bulletin boards as well. Maybe a little overkill for that purpose, but really speeds up efficiency."
"Material is Garbage. It’s velvety, so not very thin but it sheds crazy. It gets all over other layers of clothing... a mess.Fits fine. I’m 5,2 and 165# (pear shape) I got size m. Can still button up because fabric is stretchy. The shading is a nightmare though. Returning."
This top fit my 29 gal very well. Very easy to cut out the slots for the filter and cord for heater. Very easy to attach the plastic backing to the glass edge and the handle to the glass top. I recommend this canopy highly.
"I bought this ""dress"" to go to church. It was way too short and the material is see through. Very inappropriate for church. Im keeping it though because if I wear a tank top and pants/ jeans I can wear it for date night as a shirt."
These gloves have padding in the right places to protect you.They are thin enough to allow you to hold wet dishes but thick enough to pull weeds.They are as comfortable a glove as we have found.Good price for an excellent item.
"This stone has a fair clarity(not great), but an amazing energy.  This is one of the most energetic and uplifting stones I have encountered.  If you are a crystalworker, I recommend this wholeheartedly.This stone also pairs wonderfully with angelite."
unit was missing hardware to connect the frame endsframe ends were bentled lights were missing diffusion lenses and the two way tape that held them on was not doing its job (see attached pic)for the cost of this item one should expect better quality and a working item! :(
"Awesome kite. Do not thread the poles inside the fabric...KEY!!! They just lay atop the fabriv and through the loops. Easy to put together IF IF IF you do it that way. It's a BEAST the other way, which means you're doing it wrong. High flyer and beautiful bold colors!"
"I've tried quite a few different products and not only does my dog like this one, it seems to help her with her anxiety.  She gets one just about 3-4 times a week for general anxiety.  Great delivery, great product."
"I ordered three different dresses, so to choose the best one. This dress won hands down. I worried about the length, but being only 5'1 end of dress was perfect hitting right above the knee. It looks amazing on and I'm very happy with this purchase."
"Very loud!!! It will dry a Shih Tzu in 25 mins. Not strong enough for a German Shepherd or Border Collie, you’d be all day. The heating setting made the room smell like burnt hair. Small dogs….this will get you by, but for larger breeds….save your money."
"What can I say it has been a blessing , for her to be able to go outside in the yard and start swinging  ! Its wonderful and she loves it , even gives her Teddy a sing or two .Thank You"
"How can you go wrong with Lego?  I've read that they are going away from plastic to something else and noticed a few parts have more of a rubber feel to them, like the hair.  Not bad, just different.  Package came quickly and was in good shape."
very light weight and comfortable.  Just can't figure out how to put it all together at the same time.  The hooks are too small for these old fingers to try and adjust it.  And I don't fish.  I garden!
"My 13 year old enjoyed putting these together and said they are very well-made.  He was comparing to another ""robot"" set someone gave him that quickly ended up in the trash!  But this one was fun and fit together well and worked well in the end!"
"EPIC! I could not be more pleased! The pieces all fit well and the colors are pleasant. The only thing I would say could be improved is the colors on the instructions, they do not always match or, they are not defined well, hence the four stars."
"My daughter has 4c hair so I like to use a blow dryer with a pick to keep it manageable and help styles last longer. On my third use, it stopped working. I’ve tried other outlets, the reset function, etc. Nothing worked. It really worked well until it didn’t."
"My kid loves this toy. Even though he is not using the target for shooting he just likes to shoot over the ceiling and walls with all the foam bullets. The foam bullets are soft.with so many extra foam bullets, he can play without moving."
"These take a bit of extra work than the ones I buy from a party store, but it's so worth it. It's like $12 for just 6 of these at the party store near me. So getting 30 of them for this price is fantastic."
I usually loathe hipsters but then find myself ordering Field Notes to keep in my messenger bag.I keep one in the top drawer of my tool chest next to my perfect and unused Best Made Ax.Overpriced but had to have it.
Game box came taped with packing tape which ruined the outside of the box. Game box was dented and pieces necessary to the playing were  missing. Very sad boy on Easter morning. Game looks like it would be super fun but we will never know.
"The pad arrived promptly and was fairly easy to roll out.  However, it is too thin ad feels cheap: I am not a heavy guy, but I have trouble rolling my chair across the pad because it dips down wherever the wheels are"
It was packaged nicely. The colors are very pretty and although it is not the most lux material it’s pretty decent. It is a tad see through but nothing too major. A little high up in price for the quality but overall a 9/10 purchase!
I really love the color and material of this halter top.  It definitely does help shape you and hold in your tummy.  The problem is that it rolls up.  Any movement I makes causes the top to roll up.
"Perfect accessory for the 150 piece Prextex building blocks. I put the baseplate on the carpet and my 3 year old can build to his heart’s content.  He has build towers, bridges and columns and baseplate keeps them from collapsing."
"These letter charms are very pretty. The Swarovski Crystal is very sparkly and is a very nice addition to the necklace. I was also impressed by the customer service. I had a question about the charms, and they got right back to me."
"The evelopes themselves are good - good quality, easy to open, nice size.  The string closure pops off.  The rivet pulls right through the plastic with no effort (several popped off from just unwinding the string).  I am using tape to keep the envelopes closed."
"I've tried this on numerous glasses that were scratched or scuffed, and it is total garbage. Even when it does fill in the scratch, it leaves a filmy residue that makes looking through the glasses even worse than the original scratch."
I ordered an extra large because I have a golden retriever the picture of the bed shows a large breed dog in it I received a bed that is half the size of my dog. Big enough for a small to medium breed only
This Teddy was the nicest outside of Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  It came bagged in a brown paper wrapping INSIDE A GREAT blue and gold bag made of great material.  I would high recommend this teddy from Aurora World Inc.
Greatest toy for my very large puppie. Lol.  It's Moos koala squeak toy and he totally messes them up.  They are very sturdy but he plays tug-o-war with them  constantly.  He's had three so far.  It's Time to order another one.  Thanks
Super cute. Easy to clean. Our dwarf hamster always sleeps in it and it has enough room for him to add bedding to his liking. The lid nice to peek in his house without disturbing how he has his bedding situated.
"I’m sure this works well, but I returned it when I realized the sonicare-compatible heads don’t fit on it. You can only buy heads from this company, and I don’t have confidence they’ll be for sale when I need them."
"These were ok but literally everything has to put put together. The cake decorations have to be added to the sticks, the banner has to be strung, the cupcake decorations have to be put on the sticks, all before you can even use."
The belt is pretty comfortable. It is neoprene lined and stays secure and doesn't slip. The D ring is nice and large for leash to move. The includes leash is nice and made of strong nylon. Built to last works well with my pup
I had to put hot glue on the shoulder to keep it from slipping off. I have not tried it on yet. It was on top of my shoulders more than where it is suppose to be. Embarrassing with people watching you adjust your top.
This thing is terrible. It doesn't have swivels at either end. A decent leash will have swivels on both ends. So it is a nightmare to deal with twisting.It is also for really tiny wrists. Probably ok for kids 8 and under.
"These lanyards have come in very handy in helping my elementary schoolers keep track of their new face mask accessory. Durable material, easy to slip off and on, and the slider makes it so we can tighten and loosen as needed. Would recommend."
"My dog loves these toys. I would make the squeaker bigger but other than that, they are pretty fun for my little bulldog! That being said, if your dog is an aggressive chewer, pick another toy....this one won't last lol"
"This is actually grain free! Good price for grain free. However, if you can afford a better quality I do recommend buying a better quality food. However, if you want grain free on a budget, buy this. The cats do love the taste."
"She likes the squeak, the softness (easy to catch), and the football shape creates unpredictable bounces; however, it’s quite soft and therefore doesn’t bounce much. We only use it indoors as her outside ball will bounce higher, farther, and has equally unpredictable angled bounces."
"This was a gift from my husband and I love it! It's a beautifully hand crafted piece of silver jewelry, the stone is real and beautiful it's just perfect, it's really a piece of art and I haven't taken it off since I got it!"
I almost don't believe these are made of burlap because they feel so nice to the touch. I intend on using these for compostable grow bags so I hope they are! I'm excited to put my tree saplings in them to gift to people.
"Bought this for my PEDS rotation, but they are REALLY big, and I'm petite as well so it doesn't look well on me. However, they look very sturdy and nicely made, and great value for your money. If you don't mind walking around with a huge sunflower, then its nice."
This is so pretty!! I got it as a casual dress but wear it to church all the time!! I'm only 5'1&#34; and it isn't too long. Brushes the floor with out shoes. Just fine with pumps!! The collar can be tightened to be modest or a little more sexy.
Though expensive it works for a couple of weeks at a time.  Since it's concentrated it lasts me a couple of years with 2 horses.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I think it is very expensive.
"Has no flavor, nor taste.  My body didn't seem to react well to this.  It's the most amazing antioxidant known, and more nutrition than many of the top antioxidant fruits known, buy this powder doesn't seem potent.  It also seems like it has fillers mixed in."
"This doggie toy bag is exactly what I wanted.  It looks good, it's soft but sturdy and large enough to hold my dogs toys.  My golden retriever loves it, she loves digging through her toys, finding the exact one she wants and pulling it out."
"These are a little small for my hands. I can wear them, but are a little more snug than I prefer. Though the gloves themselves are very nice. I definitely will keep them, just wish they were not quite so snug. over all I like them very much."
We love this bird bath for the design and light weight but sturdy construction. It is a beautiful addition to our shade and frog pond garden. It cleans easily and again very light weight to move for mowing and weeding.
"This product is supposed to prevent gum disease.  My dogs adjusted to having it put on their teeth weekly, but I don't yet know whether they help prevent disease.  The only benefit so far is the dos' breath is more pleasant."
"Good shades are  necessary in sunshine state. I like this one very much. Not only because  the package is nice but also for the high quality. It is lightweight also.  Wearing  with a long distance driving, I did not feel any uncomfortable."
"The dolls are decent quality, but the furniture is kind of useless. The bed is too small for the dolls, none of the doors on anything actually open, and it's all pretty rickety-looking. Not suitable if you're looking for furniture that you intend for a child to actually play with."
Great smell and easy to use! Seems to work great for our dogs ears! Came with a cute poop bag dispenser and extra poop bags! We ran out of ear cleaner so we are so glad to have found this product!
"This is compact, has a protective housing, and has a grain which will perform heavy shaping while not leaving the edge of the nail very uneven. It's also inexpensive. Vastly superior to traditional emery boards or metallic files. I strongly suggest this, particularly for field use."
This phone is cheaply made and the one I received was broken. It's increasingly more difficult to find &#34;old school&#34; phones for those of us tired of having cordless handsets disappear and/or not usable during power outages. I guess you get what you pay for.
Bad flavor and I tend to like orange dream bars. When I take a hit off my vape with this juice a lot of juice bubbles pop into my mouth but when I use a different type of juice there is no pops.
"It dissolves quickly with warm water, no flavor which is good. I take it on an empty stomach in the morning before I shower. After shower and all the clean up then I take my breakfast. You can add it in you morning smoothie if you like."
"Bought a few of these for my band's music video. Looked great as props in a mental hospital. Then I recycled them and now use them for my college science courses. The wrists are elastic and fit well, and also it has pockets and buttons."
"I have been using this product for more than a year.  Even in poor light, which I have where my fountain is placed, it still grows well.  It is very convenient and neat.  My cat really likes it."
"Not enough metal back in there for the magnets to stick to?The magnets that I got stick to my REFRIGERATOR quite ell, but barely stick to the white-board!So maybe there is not enough metal in here for magnets to work very well?"
"The material (plastic) is of poor quality. We had Melissa and Doug prior to this one, which was much sturdier. The spray bottle also kept coming undone, and I had to place double-sided tape around the rim to completely seal it and keep it in place."
This is a pretty useful item. It works to relieve my neck pain. I don't use it every day just several times a week. It's easy to put on and use. I like that the pressure is so adjustable. A good simple item that works well.
"This set comes with a lot of little containers. Perfect for me since I do a lot of crafting and have a ton of different tiny little things. These are nice quality and made of a durable plastic, they snap together nicely too."
"The wrist ""cushion"" is hard and does not give at all, creating very painful pressure on my wrist. The entire reason I purchased this mouse pad was to reduce wrist pressure, so a big waste of money. Into the trash it goes."
Was super cute but was very sad that there was not enough bags and there was not enough animals for all of the Valentines. I had to improvise last minute and some kids had to get something different and that’s always a big no-no. Will not buy again.
Definitely smaller than expected but still good to have around the cage to make sure they’re drinking water. Would not use them as the main source would get a bigger one but they’re good to have on the shelves and on the different levels.
Very nice. Glad I found it on the internet but personally I feel $16.00 too much in price  for this tiny small bottle. I do like Frankincense and Myrrh.  recommend-glad when it goes on so so sale. It is a good oil.  Thanks.
"My kids love legos and my son really wanted this set.  He's 10 so he put it together wicked fast.  But plays with it a lot, it has some good things like minifigs and vehicles.  thumbs up!"
"I thought I would get an accurate cut from this product and it doesn't. I've tried cutting with the lock on, locks off, and alternating locks, but never do I get a straight cut.  It was a complete waste of my money."
I updated the latest driver of the Epson printer and now the printer does not recognize the cartridge. I tried with another new cartridge it also has the same problem. Don’t buy this remanufactured ink it is waste of money
"Bought for my daughter, the worms it come with are definitely a choking hazard. We are keeping them separate in a safe spot until she is old enough to use them. Overall great durable toy that has a lot of great things to play with."
It smashed my boobs flat and pulled the away from each other. Whatever escaped the booby trap squished out like a doughy muffin top... I was worried it was going to be too loose ... Needless to say I was worrying about the wrong thing.
Good for the price. The spring just sits in a hole that is drilled into the board so my cat keeps pulling it out. The scratching post is short so my cat doesnt use it but he does play with the spring
"I dislike that it stretches when you try to peel the film to apply it. It sticks to itself, I made a mess of the first couple of pieces and it didn't get much better. Probably will not be buying this again."
"Product arrived on time, and is of good quality.  It takes time to see the overall results of this vascular health product so I can't make an definitive review at this time.  Based on my research and discussion with my Dr., the product should help."
"Absolutely shocked about the price and the quality. We will be purchasing more collars for our furbabies. We didn’t plan to buy more. However, considering the price AND the quality, our furbabies are doing to be sporting different collars throughout week. They really are just precious!"
These is a great deal of 25 bright colored folders for the value.  The colors help me to organize and categories important papers.  They are very sturdy allowing me to put up to 100 papers in each and not tear.  Great for me as a school teacher.
"I bought one for my son, and it had gotten stolen. His old one, the paint was chipped by the 1st week and dented all over the place. This is much more durable, has had it since Christimas and still looks brand new!"
"If you give presentations at meetings and need to point at something on a screen, tv, or poster, get an extendable pointer. Laser pointers don't work on television screens. These are sturdy, portable, and very well-loved by the people I gave them to."
"my daughter is 7yrs old and a huge ninja turtle fan and she loved this mask!, its a quality mask that looks very durable from the material its made of, tuff somewhat soft rubber, and its comfortable on the face."
"Works as advertised.  Do remember to have your computer plugged into the internet when you first plug it in, drivers may need to be updated.  Battery case is hard to open, I assume that after some use it will be easier."
"Cute coat but sizes are way off!  I usually wear a medium, but based on past reviews, I ordered this item in a large and it is way to tight!  I think the sizes must be for the Asian market."
"It was a bit small in the bust section and showed a bit too much so I decided to return it. However, it you don't mind a bit of cleavage showing it's a beautiful dress and seemed to be well made! The color was also very alluring"
"I got this for my daughter.  The same day she got it, the jingles started falling off.  We love the sound, but after wearing it for only 4 days, shes down to 4 jingles on them. I wouldn't recommend buying this."
Beautiful bag. I bought it to fill and donate to a fundraiser. I was confused about what appeared to be a big pocket on the back but the bottom was actually open. Not sure of the purpose of that and did not like that feature.
There is nothing about this puzzle that I disliked it’s beautiful and fun to put together I bought it for myself I love doing puzzles every puzzle lover should purchase this puzzle for their own pleasure and or as a gift it’s a beautiful puzzle.
"This is a good prop...I have it on my Carbon Z Cub.  It produces plenty of thrust.  The only drawback to this prop...is it DOES NOT come balanced, even though they say it does.  Right out of the packaging, I had to balance it quite a bit."
"[[VIDEOID:ecdfe2d88874e49493a383be4cf97865]] Comes in pieces, very easy to assemble. Its harder to do than I remember! Kids are loving it, however, I'm going to only be hula hooping when no one is watching...I can feel a lil muscle pain in my abs after attempting to do this for a while!"
"The scarf looks like a lighter green in person.  Very thin, and not as long as I excepted, but will look good with a white tee or a jacket.  I received this product for free or at a discount for my honest review."
"I would absolutely NOT recommend this for a parrot or conure. Perhaps it’s sturdy enough for a much smaller bird, but my Quaker parrot broke this toy within minutes. The plastic is very thin and not at all suited to a strong-beaked bird."
"I liked that this relatively rare product was available at a decent price. I use couch grass as one of four ingredients in a tea that are used for medicinal purposes. As such after using it for three months, it is working very well."
"I really like the way I can control how much distance I can give Bella, and the waste bags and water dish are perfect for our long walks and being in public places. She’s a PTSD service dog and I take her everywhere I go."
"I bought these bags to replace grocery store plastic bags. They are similar in size, maybe slightly bigger, and although have just started using them, I think they are great. They take up little storage space, are sturdy and best of all they are washable."
I love the fit! This was my second dress the first one I got was white and fit perfectly so I wanted to have a black one too! I'm a minimalist so this dress is perfect I can dress it up or down for any season
Much safer and good replacement for happy but once my bird got used to it anyways update 2 months later he has obliterated it at least he had fun and he’s still using it I’ll have to buy him a replacement
"I've never had a problem with my printer until I bought these discounted ink cartridges. I tried to save a few bucks and now I'll have to go out and buy Epson ink, as well Try at your own risk."
"It's nice to have a treat that is this low in carbs, especially for the end-of-the-day snack when you've run out. It fits that bill nicely. It is just ok texture and flavor. I'll probably order them again, but they aren't my favorite."
It runs way bigger than the size chart says.  But I'm not returning it. The dog was obsessively scratching and biting and eating herself.  Vets cant figure it out.  Might be behavioral.  She hasn't bitten or scratched since we put her gear on.
"Currently doing this puzzle.  The cut is not great so there are a lot of bits of paper hanging off, some tearing of the photo too.  Kodak may have great photos, but the puzzle quality is not that of a Buffalo or Cobble Hill."
First off the metal is very cheap looking. The ribbon is very pretty though. I returned as if I was spending good money on outfit I would like my earring to at least look decent. More of a dollar store quality.
"These chips have a really great feel to them, both in texture and heft. The denomination stickers are all well-placed and clean. I am totally satisfied with the purchase of these chips and am seriously considering a second order to pick up some additional chips of alternate denominations. Highly recommended."
"A good well made running hat, bigger peak than the Headsweats race hat, some may prefer this style but for me nothing I have used yet beats the standard race hat, which is a better fit for me and made of a material which I personally prefer."
"I bought this item to hold my company ID card, but it was hit or miss as to whether the slides would work. Also, the card would just randomly fall out at times. Can’t use it and have one to a colleague and so I can’t return an incomplete set."
This is a great gift for a child. I purchase them for a birthday gift. I absolutely love what a great value this was. A highly recommended and I will continue to purchase these for stocking stuffers or birthday gift. Crayola Never Let You Down.
"My initial purchase was for size ‘large’, which are too loose to be helpful.  I am a size 9 women’s shoe.I reordered a size ‘medium’, and anticipate a good result.I like the fabric and design of these arch support sleeves.Very helpful for plantar fasciitis."
"Product was shipped fast & are very stylish. Over time the lens turned a brownish/yellow color, bends very easy, & I wud have purchased the full rim glasses or the rimless instead. Overall quality is very low. And the wood part started to pill over time."
"Great collar for the price. Keeps my dog visible at night and makes sure he can be identified if someone sees him out and about. He's an outside dog so even though the collar is in the elements, it holds up well."
Can't verify my purchase since my P205s are all about 15 years old.  That should tell you all you need to know about their quality.  I only thought to write a review after a random discussion on mechanical pencils.
"Received this in the mail today and I have to say this dress is super comfortable. The material isn't cheap, lije you can't see through but it's still cool enough that you shouldn't get hot. It was packaged nicely as well!"
My two cats like this. Pellets are very small and crunchy. High quality ingredients. Castor and Pollux seems to fill them up faster. Even though this is expensive compared to many brands all indications are that is is healthier than most and has less empty calories.
"My 4 year old nephew absolutely loves this thing - drags it with him everywhere!  I was not that familiar with the transformers concept, but after seeing this one, I have to admit the idea is cute and I can see why he loves it."
"Hubby has been smiling and silent... So  that's a SOLID 5 STARS TO YOU.... SELLER!  after 38 years of marriage, anything that makes him happy and sound-free is WORTH 10X PRICE.PLEASE SEND ME A CASE.  It's gonna be a rough year...-Happy wife of near 40 years"
"I got two of these drones, and they both suffered from motor issues which is upsetting since both were gifts. I had hoped to expect better from Traxxas since I enjoy their cars, but I'm not sure I would recommend their drone."
"I received the Jafar Genie Chase Variant. I really wanted the blue Genie. The figure I received is high quality, the box came intact with the chase variant sticker. I still really want the Genie but I'm worried if I order again I'll get the variant again."
"I searched high and low for this exact thing!  After a few failed purchases of chocolate sundae pendants (they looked like gumball machine jewelry! ), I found this pendant,  and it will make the PERFECT gift for a certain someone."
This journal is quality for what is paid. The pages are thick—no bleed through for fountain pen users. Be sure to allow a few extra seconds to let pages dry before closing or turning a page. Ordering more as gifts for my clients to encourage them on their wellness journeys.
I sought this brand for my Mother; I had previously purchased the same socks or similar for her at a retail store.  My Mom finds them more comfortable than other support hose she has tried.  The quality seems reasonably good as well.
My dogs LOVE these. The only downside is that there is only 6 in a pack. I haven't noticed any improvement in their skin or coats (my beagle has very dry skin). May consider buying these again since they loved them so much.
My Best friend had alot of pain going up stairs.. She is 12yrs old.. Signs of hip dysplasia.. This sling is amazing! Takes the pressure off her rear legs..She moves so much faster.. She loves it! Priceless to relieve my Dog of pain.. ❤
"Handed these out for Halloween to be allergy friendly. Everyone loved the idea, kids and adults!! My only complaint is that many of the connectors were broken, I would say almost half of them so they couldn’t be used as bracelets only a stick which was disappointing"
"They were cute, but on 12 sets were sent to me instead of the 24 sets I thought I was ordering. Apparently the knives and scissors were counted too, so if you order 24, you only get enough for 12 cupcakes...wish this was clearer in the description."
"DO NOT BUY THISThis garbage worked fine until it didn't. When it went bad it started shocking my pup - unrelentingly. Even just sitting on the table it would send out a shock. It terrified my dog into thinking she was being punished, and she's been spooked ever since."
I am very frustrated with this puzzle. The backs with letters don’t seem to help putting it together. I really wanted to be able to frame this one. This is third 1000 piece puzzle I’ve done.  Pieces don’t fit.
"The bottoms do not cover anything, look at customer images before buying to get an idea. That being said at this price it was totally worth it for the top, its looks great on my teenager and she loves it."
These are the worst goggles I’ve ever purchased. We could not get them to stay tight at all. They kept coming loose and falling off. The rims around the lenses are so cheap and flimsy that they wouldn’t keep the water out anyways.
"Really good to be able to choose which direction I wanted the desk set up with, negative is one of the plastic feet for the computer stand was broken and so was one of the desk feet, but overall is a great desk"
"So many socks like this say they fit the size advertised but then end up being too small.  These were perfect, if actually a little big. They were also a bit thicker than expected, which I liked. I am very happy with them"
"The figurine and plane were in the shipping box, however not in an actual package.  This toy looked used.  It was for my great niece.  I had to shop for a different box to make the gift look presentable rather than used."
Great product that I’ve been having a hard time finding at the local store. The seller went above and beyond by refunding the cost of one bottle when I bought (3) two packs and only received five bottles. Highly recommend awesome product & attentive seller.
"If they would cut back on the stevia, or come up with a stevia/erythritol combination that wasn't so in-your-face sweet, I would rate it higher.  It has a noticeable after-taste.  I only bought this product because Paleo Thin is not available right now."
"Sturdy. Cute. As pictured. Did not break like my other two badge holders! I originally wanted the holder that spins / rotates on the back, but this non-mobile clip holds up well and I guess is part of the reason why it is sturdier than other types."
I love this product!  My dog is eight years old and stopped being able to jump up on the couch.  I ordered this in February and by late April she was able to jump again.  She is so much happier and so am I!
This is just wonderful. I have shots in my eyes every 4 weeks and the sanitizer they use burns. I got these hoping that flooding my eyes to try to get all the chemical out of my eyes. It worked wonderfully.
"Everything is good. Nice structure, good for active handling. The only problem I had was the fall-off  of the strap at one end after several months. Fortunately, I brought it to the shoe repair and spent 10 dollars for tight stitches. Now it's restored in the glamour."
"I needed some leis for costumes for my students. These are pretty and well made. However, like the other reviews mentioned, throughout the day, the leis she’d like crazy. The students who were wearing black shirts looked like they were full of cat/dog hair."
"One of my cats doesn't respond to Cat Nip, but goes crazy for Honeysuckle - these toys help him remain active and they travel all over the house. I do have to do rescue operations, whereby I remove &#34;stuck&#34; mice from under the furniture, to the amusement of said cat."
"I purchased another feeder prior to this one - it didn’t work well with flake food, and the container was way too small. The container on this device is generous, and the feeder works perfectly! I’ve got it scheduled on the app and it works like a charm!"
Much smaller than expected. I read the size chart and this did not fit at all. This is not made for busty girls at all! I gave it to my friend who is much smaller than me as a gift.
The refills are a different consistency from the stuff that came with the original product pack (liquid tooth paste) and dry out within the brush dispenser.  This means taking everything apart for cleaning every two days.  The brush system is great but these reefills don't work.
Great kit. We gave it as a Christmas gift for Christmas 2020 to my cousin's 8 year old and it was so much appreciated as it entertained their child for weeks. Great way to introduce their child to how the body works by making it fun and entertaining.
"I'm wondering if there's some sort of trick to getting these to do the job they were designed to do, which is write on a chalkboard, because they don't do that. It's sort of like scraping candle wax on the board. They are completely useless."
[[VIDEOID:125f7353fe0e5ae703566ceaf8ddb63b]] Wow! This lil whale can blow some bubbles! My daughter and her cousin played with it all day at the park! The whole park was filled with bubbles. I love how it came with the bubble solution and packets to make more. Definitely recommend!
"I hate to be the guy who complains about everything however I know most collectors get mad when boxes come in damaged shape. Mine wasn't that bad though. I love the figure, he looks great with my other ones. Pretty good paint job too."
I'm kind of between a 6 and a 6 1/2 so some shoes are too tight and some are a little loose.  These pads help with the 6 1/2 for the ones that are a little loose. Adds a bit more comfort for long wear.
"THIS IS A GOOD IDEA BUT ONLY IF IT WORKED ON ME.  I HAVE TRIED IT 3 TIMES NOW AND IT DOESNT WORK. I TRIED IT ON OTHER PEOPLE AND IT WORKED. I DONT UNDERSTAND I WISH IT WORKED FOR ME, I GUESS I HAVE TO KEEP ON TRYING."
Fun product. Getting my pup not to chew the cord apart after catching the &#34;toy&#34; is not easy. Would love if they sold a &#34;cord replacement&#34; to this toy. I also haven't tried to wash the &#34;toy&#34;. I'm hoping that goes well.
Reasonably comfortable if you get it properly placed but DOES NOT hold up to washing even by hand. Glue they used could be waterproof so thay last longer for those of us who will need them for an extended period of time.
The sizing of this shirt fits like Junior clothes.  A 2xl fit like a maybe a women's size 12... would have loved the shirt if sizing was correct.  It is also a weird material poly blend of some sort.
"I ordered the smaller of the two sizes. They’re being used to hold down a door on my hamster cage which easily pops open. They do a pretty good job—when I try pushing the door open with one of these on, it’s really hard. That’s a good thing."
"Really surprised at all the positive reviews. Tried to make the forklift and compared to Lego directions, these are horrible. Also left a weird film on my hands. 550 pieces but that includes an extra giant unnecessary bag of screws."
Cards easily scan and IDs can still be seen thru holder. But  after a couple of months the plastic tabs holding the card in begin to form stress cracks and eventually break off resulting in a weak hold.  Other than that They work good.
"It is sooooooo cool! I bought it for my rabbit, and he turned into a super bunny when he wore it! Haha it was so funny.But rabbit is even much smaller than a small dog, so it was a little difficult to keep the outfit still."
"Product is small but mighty. Gets my dogs dry quick. It less noisy than my other high velocity dryer. My boy Toto hates that sound , but definitely was more calm with this dryer. In love with this dryer!!! Recommend to all!!!"
These goodie bags are AWESOME! They are super sturdy and durable. They are a pretty big size as well. They even come with these personalized tags you can write the children's name on and put them on the straps. Love these and will definitely continue to order this brand!
I had to return these sunglasses because they came damaged.  The nose piece was missing the camouflage (it was white) on one side and one lens was scratched.  Gave 3 stars because it was very easy to return.
Totally great! Really tall so my 4 year old feels like he is in his own world.  Thick canvas type material.  Not cheap or overly flimsy.  Definitely a must have for little ones who like knights and castles... And princesses!  Buy this!
So I ordered this pen which I had in chrome but lost it. I thought I was ordering the same pen which HAD a removable cap as depicted on the item. Today I received the pen but it was a ballpoint pen with twist cap. Disappointed in this order.
"Cute, warm, comfortable to walk in. Bought 18 months for tall 15 months old and is a tiny bit large for him. Very happy with it. Got it earlier than expected. We live in Wisconsin that gets very cold and I think this will keep him warm."
"These silk sleep masks are soft and stay on without being too tight. I only use a sleep mask when traveling, to help reduce light and to signal that I don't want to be disturbed.  I find these sleep masks to effectively block out the light."
"Fit is true to size. The pull string doesnt keep the boot fully closed at the top though, but my daughyer said they are comfy and warm. She likes them. Just wish the pull string was tighter at the top."
I have used oxygen absorbers on a somewhat regular basis. This particular brand was worthless. They had NO absorbing capability. Put 10 of them in a 1 quart Mylar bag and heat sealed it. They did nothing. I am returning.
"They came shrink wrapped, fluffed up as soon as I cut the pack. They are exactly as pictured. Cool little weird creepy plushies. I surprised my son with them and he loves them 🤣 he said the one is a street light"
"It is more like a fine point marker pen but unlike most marker pens, this one does not bleed through paper at all. The ink flows smoothly and consistently which allows you to glide across the paper. Another plus- it doesn't smear."
"Not the same material as the last one I ordered. The last one was more of a sweater. Thicker material and more flattering. This one is nice , however it is much thinner material and shrinks a bit. It’s not as flattering but it’s still super cute."
My wife is a montessori Pre-K teacher and got this for her room.  She is so very happy with this and is able to use to teach the class.  It is very well built and looks good as well.
"My dog loved this food initially but wouldn’t touch the last bag I purchased. Something was wrong with it. I bought another brand and she ate it without any hesitation. This dog food is expensive and since something was wrong, I won’t buy it again."
"I was pleasantly surprised with how this necklace turned out.  The writing is very small, but it is legible.  All spelling and birthstones are correct.  I got the one with 3 names.  I am very proud of it and happy with this purchase."
I got mine through the VA and I love it. I can stream from my computer my TV or anything with a headphone jack. It's great I can mute the TV and still listen to it. The best accessory I have.
This is an excellent product and I recommend it for those who have a prostatic eye. It cleans the gunk off very well very well and is easy to use. Amazon has the best price by far and I looked all over.
I purchased these binoculars for my 2.5 year old toddler. He loves going on pretend bear/lion hunts and we have a lot of wildlife in our backyard. Our adult binoculars were too heavy/big for him but these are the perfect size and weight for his toddler stature.
"Really liked these bags -- so lovely for gift giving.  High quality paper used, bags measure 13"" x 4"" x 5"" each.  I got these in the black and gold -- 2 with polka dots and 2 with spots.  These are top notch. Beyond pleased."
"This is not the same product I’ve been using for 10 years and not the same product advertised. They changed the ingredients, packaging and scent. So disappointed and will no longer buy from this company. Why change a great product to make it worse?"
"I like the collar as far as fit and hardware, etc.  I gave it only three stars because the characters are so small, they appear to be dots of various color.  We'll still use it.  It does have nice spring colors."
I'm convinced this doesn't self warm. I've let my dog lay on it for hours and felt it right after and it didn't feel warm at all. He doesnt even like it. It isn't soft and it doesnt stay put in his kennel.
Cute and comfy for my two rats they climbed right in and curled up. More then enough room for both rats. Seemed well supported by the clips. I'm sure they will chew it but it's very well made and the zippers allow Fu it easier washing.
"These pens make any ink drawing a thing of beauty!!!  Long lasting, durable, water resistant, and so easy to use as they glide across the paper.  Will continue to buy them as needed.  Excellent price a year ago, but probably have gone up with inflation!"
i just love this deal might not run out of ink for a while 3 of all the colors a great deal  areal good company good ink  the best ink yet works well  with hp  5520
"It looks like these were heat damaged.  They are too narrow for a standard 8.5"" sheet of paper (I measured the paper to make sure).  I tried a protector from the middle of the pack as well and it was pitted and dempled."
"I have cats, and no surprise, that means snags on my sweaters. With this little gem, you put it on the pulled thread and push into the fabric. Voila!! It's fixed!! No more telltale loops! Works on bracelet or earrings pulls as well!"
"Absolutely beautiful! Exact design, color, style I wanted.  Love the shine!  Larger in life than I expected, from the pic, so if you expect small, check the length.  I didn't, but not returning it.  It is gorgeous!"
"This swing is really huge and the wooden perch is very broad, smaller or even middle birds may not be able to perch well. I have a green cheek conure and he has problem getting a good grib. Overall it's a well made swing."
My daughter loves using these for her college classes. She has one for each class. They are perfect for taking notes without having to carry heavy spiral bound notebooks. We over these every year. She loves that the pages are thicker and hold up well and ink doesn’t bleed through.
Zero directions on how to load labels. Rubber feet from machine are TIGHTLY glued to inside of shipping box!  NO spacers to prevent label roll from moving side to side. I finally found directions on side of unit: very confusing to first time user.
If you are looking for a bright tactical light for less than $40 this is it. Cant comment on the long term quality yet but the claimed 3800lm is not brighter than my 800lm Fenix TK-35 that is much more portable and ergonomic.
"Yes. My rabbit loves the soft fuzz on her fur and even Chocolate Mustard, the chicken says it's the best thing she's ever layed an egg on!And she keeps coming back to lay more eggs on it! My poor bunny!!"
"This is a gorgeous tote.  We saw someone at EPCOT carrying one, and she had bought it at the 2017 Food & Wine Festival.  This looks just like the one she had, and the price is competitive with online auction sites."
"Love the breathable, lightweight, soft, comfortable, cool material it’s made out of is just right! Doesn’t stick to your mouth, allows an air pocket to breath comfortably. You can wear it long periods of time outdoors without it causing you to sweat like other kinds do.Highly recommend!"
"These are durable office rubber bands. I used them for doing the wreck this journal with my daughter, but we have also used them for some other projects around the house. I would recommend these for many many uses. I am very happy with the product."
Went to blow these balloons up for my son's birthday party and the 2 big sonic  balloons had holes in them and wouldn't hold air.  No place local had sonic balloons so we only had the 2 round ones and the 2 stars...huge letdown
I was looking for a canvas over sized shoulder bag for my laptop a d note books. And I came across this bag. Let me just me ruin that it got here really fast. Sooner than what it stated. The bag is perfect. Sturdy. Great material. Well.made
The anount of decorations for the price exceeds satisfaction! I even took a few into the store for helium inflation but no worries the handheld air pump came in handy! Only one of the balloons had a small air leak. My son loved it! Great value for the price.
The balloons were super flimsy and ugly colors. Some of the balloons popped simply by blowing them up by mouth. The birthday banner came disassembled and some pieces didn’t even have holes punched for the string. The character pieces and birthday topper also came disassembled.
"Super soft and comfortable, but dont expect to wear it open, the pockets dont exist except on the inside, and the zipper start is surrounded by an easily frayed fabric that will no doubt make it impossible to zip up after a few washes."
"This dress is so adorable!! It is really good material and put together nicely. I bought a Small for our 6 month old, 7lb Chiweenie, knowing she would grow into it. I'll for sure be buying more dresses from this company!"
"Bought this for my wife. Each button has its own function, so no need to try to remember (or read very tiny print) what other functions the buttons might do. I prefer my Calculated Industries Conversion Calculator, but bought this for her and she loves it!"
"Was so excited about this one, purchased a 10 pack for only .99! Shipped fast very cute to look at... however every single one ripped after one use 😐 the ones at the dollar store last longer then that... will not buy again"
I thought the silly putty was great. It's a little stiff but silly putty loosens up as you play with it. The annoying thing though is that the red silly putty leaves red dye all over your hands. I'm hoping this stops happening after a few uses.
"Love the fabric and the style. Wash and wear, easy prays. Bought it two colors and would buy more if they went beyond the basics. Does run a smidge big, so if you’re looking for a fitted cut, go down a size. Otherwise this rocks!"
The rolling and cutting tools are fine but the letters and other shapes are so tiny they are really hard to use with play doh. They are so small you can barely get your finger in to push the doh out after pressing with the molds.
"Didn't care for the lowrider options, but the stock options were very nice. Seems to be a bit more detailed than the three or four other level 2 Revell kits I've built, which is a good thing in my book."
Works great for both of my dogs skin and doesn't have that nasty fish smell. One of my dogs is a schnauzer so everything he eats gets in his beard and he used to smell so awful with the last brand we tried. Definitely worth it
We were so disappointed.  I thought this was a book.  My daughter received pages not put together and everything was in Chinese.  My grandson can scribble on the pages but this was nothing like what was shown on the website.
"I’m 5’4 and 150lb, I ordered a size Large after reading the reviews and it is STILL too small. It also is not the same color as the picture, it’s more bright and pink. It’s a cute dress, just sizing is terrible and very cheap quality."
We have been purchasing from our local pet store but it was usually sold out.  Found it on line and for a better price.  Absorbs well and keeps orders down.  Arrived as indicated.  will order again.  The G-pig loves to hide in it too.
Naehhhh.  Raggedy...expensive ....I have the grey and black one totally different from it ...This hat not what I expected... so to all the u hats lovers out. I don’t recommend this item....I don’t even know how to return this items and get my money back ...
"The seam between the legs came undone after wearing them once. Fabric is thin and does not give you that support and lift that other leggings do . Design is nice, if fabric was higher quality/thicker these would be decent leggings"
I’m very disappointed with the quality. There are bubbles in the finish on the “sisters” that make them look very cheap. They are also way smaller than I thought they would be. I’m trying to decide if I even want to give them to my sisters.
"Had this for almost a month and is holding up great, its stays put, and has little ridges that help you not slip. Would be great for someone who is elderly for that reason, and it looks very spa-like as well!"
"Sent this to my Mother as a Just Because Gift!  She Absolutely Loved It...  On the very first day she wore it, she revived so many comments  She said it Beautiful...  This gift did exactly what I intended it to do.. Warm my Mums Heart!"
"Very cute, would be great for little dogs. My full size dogs had these split in the belly and neck in less than an hour, stuffings coming out. My big dogs aren't major toy destroyers either, this was just from playing."
"The only hangups I have is related to the thickness of the floss. It's quite hard to get in between my teeth safely. Also, I've learned to leave a tail of a couple of inches hanging so that the floss doesn't get pulled back into the bottle."
"These socks are meant to represent the carpet in The Shining film. They are day glow construction orange and cheaply printed meaning the seam on the sides is WHITE and when you try to pull them on they stretch, ruining the pattern. AVOID. Returning. Look elsewhere."
"This has been a huge hit with my six month old--guaranteed to calm him down when other toys fail.  He's really into the rings around the legs and ""tasting"" the mitten hands, and I think the pulling legs and arms will also be fun when he gets older."
Very nice quality.  It doesn't stretch as much as my leather cover but then again I really didn't need to stuff that one as much as I did.  I like the fact the cover is black and will always look nice.
"This safe is absolute garbage. The front pad is just barely glued on and some of the numbers don't work. I could literally by a better one at Walmart for the same money, which is what I'll have to do now since this one is useless"
"Easy to clean, easy to put together, kitties loved it! It is a very soft and pretty pink color so looks great in any room. The food-catching part of the design actually works really well and the kitties picked off the pieces that feel there while they were eating.Highly recommend!"
"You can't see through the mask.  There are tiny holes for eyes and fur all around it.  I wish it had eyes for the bear like the bison does, really adds to mask.  Will have to make eye holes bigger."
Total garbage. Little to NO scent.  I assumed by buying one that was a little my more expensive it would have an explosive scent. Not the case. $20 each is a joke on my checkbook. So annoying when bad sellers leak on to Amazon.
These are cute and effective. My one qualm is the “out to lunch/gone for the day” hanger is slightly smaller than the other hangers with a less wide hole to hang it by which bothers me a bit. Overall they are nice and work well for my office though.
Purchased this howstar chiffon tops. The colour was really beautiful. But the inner material is rough and it is similar to plastic sheet. I bought this top along with two other tops. The other 2 fits perfect but this one is too tight.
"I'm in LOOOOVE with this self care journal.  Quality cover,  spiral and thick pages.  Many wonderful thoughts and daily prompts.  This will be a great companion to my devotional journal.  I highly recommend this gorgeous journal."
This order came totally incomplete. There was absolutely no play credit cards at all.No half dollars at all.$1- only 18$5- only 16$10- only 17$20- only 17$-50- only 18$100- only 18Pennies- 17Dimes- 18Quarters- 17Nickels- 19Half Dollars- 0I guess the seller didn't think I was going to count it.
NOT PERMANENT ON PLASTIC.  WRITES ON IT OK BUT COMES RIGHT OFF. I BOUGHT TO REDO MARKINGS ON PLASTIC MEASURING CUP.  VERY DISAPPOINTED. The cap won't stay on whether  open or closed.  I threw them away.
"ALmay has always been my favourite and with the powder fresh scent, even better. The multi pack of 12 was a fantastic bargain. Locally at a department store or drug store would have spent a lot more and the convenience of Amazon can't be beat. Great Marketplace seller."
"I don’t know why anyone would leave this a negative review. It is heavy, well-made and considering I live in Phoenix, a wooden birdhouse is out of the question as they do not last. I am very pleased with this product"
We love this trike. Sturdy enough for our 3 year old to push her sister around. I like that the pedals can be set to not spin with the wheel. Makes my nervous toddler feel more secure to have her feet still.
"The product came as pictured. Don't bring it into the sun as it is so shiny it may blind you. I am giving this as a gift but I am so impressed with this item, I may buy one for myself."
"This little broom and dust pan is perfect for cleaning up my bearded dragons cage. It gets 4 stars instead of 5 because sometimes the debris falls through the hole in the dust pan. Also, I only received one but the description said it was a set of two."
"I love this, but the top is too small and the bottom is too large lol. I am going to take it to a seamtress to have her make it two pieces with a zipper on the skirt part, then it should be ok."
the picture posted on the product list does no justice for these Bobo earring.  I had to fight my daughter to keep the white one I just received.  They are absolutely beautiful and the price for them is great! A Recommended item indeed.
"I thought these glasses were pretty cheap for blueblockers, and now I know why. I ordered the #2 because I needed a stronger pair, but these are useless. They’re either the wrong strength marked as a #2 or they’re very bad quality. Either way, don’t bother with them."
"It fit, that wasn’t the issue. No matter where I put the elastic waist band, just didn’t work. I looked like I was 15 pounds heavier than I am. Not flattering for my pear body shape at all. It gave me NO shape. Definitely returning it!!"
Kept the puppy busy looking for the hidden treats. Some times he just shakes it to get them out faster. If he can reach it it pulls it away before I can get it all hidden so I know he likes it.
If your a normal 9-5 worker along with having responsibilities you can have this responsably after work to relax and go in a different frame of mind (relaxed that is) and be nice and ready to start your next day of work!
"My daughter loves everything about these boots, the only negative would be that one of the buttons fell off after  just two days of wearing the boots. thankfully, we didn't lose the button and easily  sew it back on."
"This fun poker game makes a great gift. It comes with lots of well-made tokens, cards and a nice case. The case is portable but heavy, most likely my son only used it at home. Everything looks like the photos."
"I know some people just keep wearing glasses, just for 'cool', even if they really don't, but I am very happy that this color is commensurate with my face shape so I bought these because they are cheap, I like style, and are very durable !"
Was very disappointed with this! It leaked when filling up with ice! It added a nice touch to a graduation party but with all that leaking maybe putting it by the grass or on the grass would be the way to do it.
"Theoretically, this should work: IF you have a tiny dog who poops on a golf course!  If you have a normal sized dog, and a normal yard, don't waste your money.  Whatever you are doing now, it will work better than this."
"I've had these airing out since I received them weeks ago, due to an unreasonably bad smell. If I had to guess it's coming from the particle board layer wedged between these two thin sheets of wood. It really is awful, and it's still not dissipated."
"Fit and style are perfect but one of the rivets fell off pocket after a day and the zipper keeps going down on its own after a week of use.If weren't for those 2 things,  then would have given 5 stars"
This is so adorable. Many people ask me if this is kate spade. The only reason I took 1 star off is that the way it is attched to the key chain looks like it will not hold up very long. However for the money it's great.
"They are working fine. Although, the non-skidding aspect of the book ends aren't very good. The hole in the middle does allow for a screw or small nail to attach to a shelf if necessary. Overall, not a bad product for the money!"
In corrections it is most important to work as a team. When my shift each has one of these wristbands it boosts moral.  You feel like you are an important part of a team. They are what we wanted and are comfortable to wear.
I ordered quite a few tops to wear in Batuu. This was the only one I kept that really fit the bill. I am happy with the fit. It is flattering and well made. I would buy more colors if there was a larger selection.
"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME, the ""PROTECTIVE"" covering on both sides is impossible to get off seriously we had to use putty scrapers which in return scratched the plexiglass I bought them for my hotel front desk cant even use then am contacting Amazon and returning"
"I love Alba Botanica, but this moisturizer was just not for my skin type. I have normal to sensitive skin, but it just didn't moisturize my skin. It felt tacky and sticky after I would apply it. I truly gave it a chance, but it just wasn't for my skin."
Bags were cute but much smaller than stated. They are not 11 inches by  7  and do not open to 1.87 inches.they are more like 8 by 5  inches.  Tiny and can't fit much in there
"My son loved this box! He couldn't find it in any store near us, so we ordered it and it came as expected. It had so many great cards that he couldnt control himself. I have never seen so many rare cards in one box."
"Bought this, based on description,  for dog training.  Instructions stated ""set to training mode,  alternative mode will injur dog."" However,  device is labeled setting I and setting II, with no way to know which is which. Therefore,  it is useless."
"It's kinda cheaply made.  For the price I understand, but whole point is to look elegant.  The sleeves are puffier than expected and the bottom was completely open. If you to wear in your own private mansion go for it but I returned it.  Pass for me"
"Very unhappy with the seemingly poor quality, unnecessary complicated voice mail setup, volume control, etc., etc.  Returned it and bought a Panasonic -- a mfr with whom I've been very satisfied in the past -- instead.  So far I'm very happy with the Panasonic."
"These are awesome GF crackers.  On a recent trip visiting family in Michigan, they had purchased these as I am GF.  I have yet to find them here in Oregon but LOVE them, so may have to order from Amazon.  Great flavor and nice a crisp!"
"My 7 year old son loves this lego. He's recently into Harry Potter and has had hours of fun playing with this.  Even after he takes it apart, he'll build his own with some of the pieces.  Lots of fun."
I wish I would have known exactly how big this thing is because I would not have bought it. It is HUGE and the candle is the only thing my puppy can grab onto to play with. I am going to look into returning it.
"This dress was perfect for what I needed it for...a Derby Party! It fit like a glove. I normally wear sz 4 (5'3&#34;, 130 lbs) and it was perfect. The fabric had a slight stretch to it so sitting, bending and walking up stairs was easy."
"They're nice and lightweight but sturdy. The first time I put them on I thought 'these are comfortable'  Was hoping that they would be darker than the picture and they are. Look like ZZ Top cheep sunglasses. Look good on me, I'm happy."
My two dachshunds love this treat.  My only concern is that it contains salt and another ingredient I don't think is good for dogs.  I am used to buying such item with just the Duck as an ingredient and no additives.
"over all its a good product but i had issues where i had to take it apart a couple of time to insert more spacers to make it so the keys wouldn't turn out every time i held it side ways, but once i did that it was smooth sailing."
This pool is tiny! Super tiny! Miniature! Small! Itsy bitsy! Little! Compact! Mini!The slide doesn't hold any weight. There isn't a step for the kids to get up on the slide. It does stay inflated though. Might be suitable for a TINY baby less than 1 year old.
This wouldn’t hold up very well in an office. It’s just not sturdy enough. I use it to hold my grandson’s art work and drawing papers. We glued the shelves together since he was frustrated when he touched it and it fell apart.
"XL Won't fit a  60lb pitbull.  I bought it for my 75 lb boy but it didn't fit.  Put on my 60 lb girl, won't fit either.  The headpiece on an extra large is for the size of a lapdog."
"It came like open in box, it’s almost like the toy was cut out and the dinosaur was not in it either! I’m very upset because my son just came out of hospital and really wanted this as a surprise."
"I had one and it quit working after 5 years. Love how easy it is to use and only takes me about 5 minutes to go from crazy hair to styled. This new one is kind of cranky and noisy, but still does the job."
Love the fabric and design but they are a very tight fit.  Size up one!  An XL normally fits me perfectly but not this one- so tight the back on my calves have sideways wrinkles. My hips are 42”
"This was a gift and the recipient loved it. Actually, most of the other girls went bonkers too. This brand has taken off like crazy in the 1st-3rd grades were we have friends. They’re like hugging a smooth, fleece marshmallow."
"My 8 year old daughter loves this panda onesie PJ. The top fits her perfectly, but the legs a little long so we just rolled them up and it gives her room to grow in it.. although I bought the one for size 10 so bought bigger."
I was completely surprised and Impressed  on the Great Quality and Look of this Body Chain.  I Absolutely Just Love Everything About It and The Best Part of this Body Chain is it is Adjustable !!  I Will Absolutely Order From This Company Again.
I don't eat breakfast...I started taking these for breakfast and felt much more balanced. No hunger pangs or headaches waiting for lunch. I researched their website and found how they grow an process. Got good info...gave to his kids..they never got sick.
"Great card if you use it together with legendary ocean, or find yourself often having water monsters out, summoning a nice strong monster without tribute can be very beneficial, I think it can support low level water decks pretty well."
"I bought this shirt for my 11 year old son who loves computers. It seems to be well made. The print is nice and vibrant. It fits perfectly and is a nice, soft, silky knit. My son loves his computer shirt!"
"This float works very well. It holds our son which weighs 20 pounds. There are other brands out there, but this one works great for our needs, and safety is not compromised. I am the type that is very detailed, but I have no problems or concerns with this item."
"Love the concept of this top, but the material was too thin for me.  I need a little more weight in my shirts so they don'y &#34;cling&#34; to every imperfection.  Fast delivery, and no problems returning to merchant."
"too small for older kids, say above 7. No eraser on the end so you have to keep track of the one provided. I found the Bic thicker 1.3mm pencils to work even better. My daughter used this pencil for only a week and then wouldn't touch it."
"My dogs live these treats.  I am concerned about Chinese made.  Ingredients: sweet potato 55%, chicken 35%, glycerin 3%, Peanut protein 3%, Cassava starch 2%, Sorbitol 2%.  It is treated with irradiation not US sourced.  I would prefer a product made in the USA"
Great comprehensive compliance poster for our small business that met all state and federal labor laws in one easy purchase. Great lamination for holding up to wear and tear. All we had to do was add our WC contact and we were done !
Comments:The item is as described.....CPAP supplies are just way over priced across the board for what you get. They have you conered and they know they can charge whatever they want. So 3 stars is all I'll ever give to anyone who price gouges any patient that needs medical suplies
A very nice light weight pen. A converter is not available for this pen.  Just ink cartridges.  I clean out the used cartridges and refill with my ink of choice using bottled ink and a syringe. Not difficult for seasoned fountain pen users.
"The top has black scuff marks all over it, the door is missing, & the stairs don't actually attach.I bought this to keep my lab out of the litter, & since it was only $40, I'll try it. But you get what you pay for."
"Love the idea of these. I hate plastic bags of all kinds, and try to reduce my overall waste. But these break very easily.  My husband will now preemptively double bag it with a regular trash bag, which defeats the whole purpose."
"No comprendo porque si los globos son azules, todo es azul para decorar a un niño porque la corona es con rosado y trae flores! Le quite las flores y la volví a decorar para poderla usarla con my baby boy. Del resto todo bien! Buena calidad."
Looks exactly like photo but fabric is thinner than I expected. Would need a slip or seamless under garments.  I decided to return. Also there was a small spot on front of dress. I didn't try it on so I know it came that way.
"This product worked awesome the first two times maybe, after that it lost suction power and there's so many different piece to keep track off, not to mention where it plugs in no matter what will get water in it."
This is a game changer on the water. Our family and friends have thoroughly enjoyed this. Our 1.5 year old little girl absolutely loves playing in the little pool. This float is built extremely well and looks to be made to last for many years. Great product!
A little disappointed in some of these. Several are not appropriate for children and was quite shocked to see them. Gave 3 stars cause the rest were fine. Definitely go thru them first if you are buying for a child.
"Beautiful shower head... nice weight to it, and you can tell it's made well. Only has 1 spray configuration, but my shower feels amazing with the filter, the water no longer smells bad and the over all quality of the piece is top notch."
My wife is a teacher in her first year at a new school and it was absolutely embarrassing what they were asking the kids to use. We purchased these for the kids and they were thrilled. They are a good quality product that students will use for years.
"The internal parts are all plastic.  In particular, the axle is set in a pair of plastic plates in which it rotates when used  The bearing assembly that was supposed to protect the plastic separated and the plastic supports fell apart.  Stay away."
"After reading reviews I thought this product would be better made. The base is plastic, not wood. It is very cheaply made. Comes directly from China. There are others on Amazon chesper, probably same quality. Easily tangles. Would not give to a child. Works OK on my desk."
I love these boots!!  I have a wide toe area and these boots fit very comfortably!  The traction on the bottoms are great as I can wear them in snow with hardly any slippage.  Plus they are super cute.
Very impressed by these tooth brushes. Easy to grip with with two types of brush sizes on either end. Works well for small or large dogs. These worked great with my small breed dogs. They clean easy as well. Pleased with this more biodegradable option over plastic. Will buy again!
"Durable, thick material; D-rings on all sizes I have ordered (1.5-3""); soft rubberized material which is comfortable to hold, the other brands use vinyl or plastic and have slick, sharp edges. I have replaced all my old plastic/vinyl binders with the ""Better Binder."""
"I love this product so much that when my bag was stolen, this was one of the first items I replaced.  Unfortunately, now that the eraser has run out, the search for replacement erasers is on.  Problem solution should be easy: list the dimensions of usable erasers!"
I bought the set for my granddaughter for Christmas. It’s not Christmas yet. I was surprised at what we got for $55. Thought there would be more to it. But I’m sure my granddaughter will be happy and that’s what matters
I love this jacket. It came just in time for the polor vortex we had. Really warm. As far as size I got the 2xl it fits a little big but it works in case I need to wear a sweater also
My dog and I love this brush. She Luke's the waybot feels when I brush her. Hair is easy to gather and throw away with a click of a button. Works very well and leaves your dog feeling groomed and soft.
I didn't like anything about this product.  There is no way you can attach them to your glasses that I can see.  I am sending them back.  I only gave it a one star as there was no 0 star.
"The product description and picture for this are not for the same product. Nonetheless, it is performix pre-workout and I was as able to get for a good price. The flavor is not the best, but just slam it and you can’t taste it anyways."
"The color was supposed to be green but was a turquoise blue. I was disappointed as these were for a costume. However, I gave 3 stars because they are really soft and comfy, but blue isn’t my color so I’ll wear them to lounge around the house."
I love this dress. The buttons are not real which is great if you're a bit bustier and usually have a hard time with the girls popping your buttons. The fabric is thick enough that it's not see through and feels very well made. Very flattering
Love this - it will be perfect to wear when my baby bump starts showing more! Fits great and is a good length! Down to my knees and I am 5'2&#34;! Will be super cute with a blazer! The fabric is soft and feels great to wear!
"Cleans well, next best thing to  bathing .  The scent is delicate and clean.  I like this product very much, just as it is .  Please do not change anything about it.  There is no need to improve."
It fit ok look cheap and doesnt cover my nose tightly with the mask inside cant talk with it on it fell off even with the ear strap..send with missing ear plug. I will look for a better mask this one I will give it away.
"Runs a little bit small, but I love it. The print quality is good, and the fabric doesn't stretch a whole lot which means the print will stay crisp, but maybe consider going a size up if you're usually on the fence"
"We have two kitties and they love it! They sleep all over the choices the condo offers. They run up and down it playing happily. They will surprise each other where ever one is on the condo. Great communication with this purchase. Highly recommended, great for kitty excercise."
"I did't realize that the clip only went down to the  nub of the handle.  So it just sits there unused. I went out and bought another one at the store. It works ok, it just won't hold my hair enough to curl it."
I have to say the little fellows and ladies love climbing up and down on this Mossey stuff. The trick is you do have to keep it moist for them. And make sure they don’t get stuck behind it in the tank.
"My cats like the. All 3 batted them around and rolled on them. No chewing yet, but that's ok. the circle thing is as big as a necklace. We put it around their scratching post and it was a hit."
Anyone camping or traveling should carry this in their pack. It is a life saver when no soap is available and great when the only soap available has perfume that gives you a headache. This is head ache free as far as I can tell.
Although these look like tennis balls they are much smaller. They are a great size for pups or smaller breeds. Our corgi is on the small side and loves them as they are easier for her to handle than the normal sized ones but just as durable.
What a joke the photo shows a large top I tab and the tab is 1/4 of this what a complete waste of time and money do not buy these. The photo for this item is no where near what it shows
"This made a cute gift for my husband. Only things I would of liked improved is the sound it has a decent  power for the sound but I would of liked it to be loader than it is. Other than that a adorable gift, nice soft Lil light."
I bought this for my 2 year old thinking we'd use the smashing aspect of the game. But he REALLY loves the fishing game. It's helping him with colors bc I tell him which color crab to get etc.Work really well!
I got this to hang next to my keyboard so that I can put sheet music not in use in it. It holds it all perfectly! It’s amazing how such a small item made a huge difference at my little music corner.
Always a treat when you come in from doing your business. We all love these. They rend not to dawdle out there when I give them a whif of one of these before they go out. They love them. Highly recommend
The necklace was missing a butterfly charm& some were facing the wrong way. My daughters bday was the following day so I had to adjust them myself. She liked it but has no idea the work I had to put in to make it look wearable.
great product definetly durable lights very bright only thing is the cover for charging port came right off its nothing to worry about just would keep an eye on that piece as its small you lose it its gone lol
Not that I am overly well-endowed. But the big one broke almost immediately the little one barely fits over one of my nuts when they worked properly it made it twice its size and veiny as shit so for pleasuring the woman a plus durability not so much
After shining this light on my carpet I discovered that my dogs have been sneaking tinkles! Gross! Long story short I am getting new carpet. Hopefully pee free this time! (fingers crossed) At least I am armed with an amazing flashlight so I can stay on top of it!
"This spiral notebook with pockets offers a perfect way for me to take notes during online classes and organize handouts. The cheerful cover is nice and durable, so I don’t have to worry about it ripping. This notebook helps keep things organized."
"Very cheaply made. Very disappointed. the quality is terrible and it has a strong smell to it. Very unhappy, the picture looks better than the real deal. Flimsy straps and the so called &#34;buckle&#34; barely goes through the side piece."
"It is very, very similar to any caffeine-like booster.In my humble opinion, although quite affordable, it is ineffective or almost ineffective.Certainly did not do anything special to me and I cannot suggest it to others.Very likely will not do harm, as well."
"I ordered this cartridge set before I run out of ink.  Three months later when I needed it didn't work and I can not return it to Amazon.  Don't buy these products unless you need them immediately,  You may be wasting your money as I did."
"The product looks great, but several of the beadlock screws snapped during assembly and this is the first product that I have had this problem with. I’m going to stick to Integy and other brands I know from here on"
These puzzle pieces are very very thin.  Never came across a puzzle where the pieces are super thin. Very disappointed  in this purchase really thinking about sending this back not worth the money that I spent on it.
"These are not waterproof in any way and the adhesive pretty much just sticks to paper. We tried on metal, plastic, and fabric and the tags come right off. Even the printing can be wiped off with a little pressure and a dry finger. Do not waste your money."
Sometimes I felt that it worked in my neck.... but sometimes I didn't feel any betterness... I used to put it in my neck when I go to exercise y and when I go to bed. I wash it once a week with the bathroom soap.
"Have two cats, one with irritable bowl syndrome. Use this because of all the grain frees, this works best for my IBS kitty. Duck is the recommended flavor for this condition. Love Amazon prime and the convenience of having it delivered to my door."
"My older hen loved these and wanted more ALL THE TIME! LOL.  Haven't given them to the pullets yet since they're only 8 weeks old , but they will be eating them as well once I order a new box !"
My 19 month old daughter loves this! We went fishing and she was still too little to actually fish with her brother so I got her this so she could feel included. She loves it and has gotten alot of entertainment out of it. Good quality!
"Yes, you need the right kind of group, but everyone I've played this game with has loved it! We all think we won't know enough of the persons on the cards but are always surprised at how accessible it is. Makes for some fun arguments on game night!"
"Would work fantastic if it came with nylock nuts instead of standard nuts . The threads are too short to use a jam nut , and if you tighten it doesn't turn with a servo like it should, the nut will fall off then that's loss of control surface."
"I Like all of Jada batmobile line. This One doesn't disappoint. The color application, details on the figurines could be more detailed but at this price point. It's decent. The back canopy doesn't open like in the videogame. Overall Great item from Jada Toys"
"This is a very good lighter.  It has a strong flame and is easy to refill.  If you are looking for a lighter to go in a golf bag or keep at the office, this will fit the bill perfectly."
"I just ordered this swimsuit for my daughter. While it's very cute, it wasn't what was pictured. What I received was a seahorse shirt (as pictured) and solid bottoms. The bottoms match the shirt, but they're not nearly as cute as what is pictured here."
"Bought it for my son's 8th birthday. He enjoyed putting it together and it seemed very durable when assembled, but it only worked as a remote control car for a day. The next morning the car wouldn't move even with new batteries. He was pretty bummed."
"This looks so beautiful i want this so much, God bless you for making such gorgeous healing crystals. I pray you get a lot of business i would help you, however I don't have money, so all i can do is give you abundence of luck.🌈"
"We couldn’t get the pieces apart to install the feather in the middle, and the catnip ball spinner in top really doesn’t spin well. My girls pulled out the fabric/yarn balls and have ignored it since. Even the kitten wasn’t enamored after a minute or so."
After reading a ton of reviews saying they fit exactly like the trojan xls I bought these. Unfortunately this was not the case. They were much smaller than the Trojan xls so if you are looking for a good alternative be ware.
"I needed to replace last year's wall calendar.  The price was cheap enough, but the paper stock also reflects that as its not very heavy/sturdy.  I won't be writing on it, just wanted it for the calendar and the photos, so it works for me."
"I gave this 3 stars because I don't know how to rate it. It was a good price and the pills are easy to swallow, but have a slightly musty odor (it doesn't appear to me to be the odor of the vitamins themselves)."
"One of my cats tends to eat too fast sometimes.  These cute feeding dishes were taken to immediately, as cats enjoy a more interesting way to eat the kibble portion of their meals.  Dishwasher safe on top rack is a plus too."
This is a very pretty top that fits like a M/L not an XL and feels like a kimono. I was hoping for a comfortable top and unfortunately did not realize I ordered from a third party and will not be ordering from this company again.
Very cute and more comfortable on your wrist than the plastic/rubber material. The colors are actually more attractive than I expected too. I was worried they'd be dull and hard to distinguish. If they didn't come 8 in a pack I'd be ordering more right now!
Bought one of these at Walmart. The intake tube grate wouldn't fit onto the tube. It was too small. Returned it and got another. It fit properly. Installed and will monitor how it works. So far its quiet with a pretty strong output.
Worked well for beach bachelorette party! I was at the end of my helium tank so i think that was why they didn't float extremely well but I just taped them against the wall so they would stay in place. I would definitely buy them again!
"It looked pretty good. Pretty much like in the photos. Seems overpriced for the quality. FYI, this ran very small. Was super snug on me when I’m normally swimming in XL. I’m going to try returning it for the next size up."
I live in a very large apartment complex next to a major forest so we have a lot of feral cats in the complex.  I get this cat food because it is a great price for a 44lb bag of food and its made for outside cats.
These gloves are okay to use for touch screen phones in cold weather. Sometimes I have to hit the screen a few times for them to work or I can to touch it at different angle. I usually just ended up taking my glove off.
"This is a well-made dog training whistle. I like the size of it, and the carrying case with the clip. It is working well for my hard-headed terrier! I just hope it will hold up with lots of use, as I help train others' dogs, too."
"If anyone needs instructions on how to fire it, we figured it out, haha. You have to pull the handle down to cock it. Hold the button down, and fling the hammer hard in the direction you want to fire. It's pretty cool! He loves it!"
I've been wearing Pro Step inserts for several years but decided to expand my territory a little to find a less expensive option. I'm very pleased with these inserts. They compare to the ProStep but are significantly less costly. I have ultra high arches so comfort and support are important.
I really like this.  I actually bought it for my dog to wear during the day.  She hasn’t had surgery - I just keep it on her to keep her from throwing hair all over the place when she shakes!
"Though my mother still insisted on keeping it due to her unrelenting southern manners.... It was received a mottled grey/black and white - instead of blue and white. You can barely make out the pattern, and it was stiff to the touch. I would not buy again."
"By far my favorite pinion. Basically indestructible super high quality steel, huge grub screw that both holds onto the motor shaft well and is nearly impossible to strip, and laser engraved numbers so you don't have to count teeth every time haha"
Just got the ring today and the quality is amazing given the price. The 10.25 felt small compared to my other rings of the same size from other sellers. I'm planning on returning and replacing with a larger size because it looks great.
I wore these leggings one time and they ripped in the butt. The rip is like a run in panty hose.  I ordered another pair in a different size thinking it was me but it they ripped as well.
STOP!!!!Dint waste your money !!!! I they are the size of a marble...and they stunk so bad by the time they got here 2 months later !!! BECAUSE they come from China !!! Had I known that I would have NEVER!! Purchased them in the first place
"I was skeptical about how it would fit, but it fit better than I expected. I love how flattering and stylish it is. It's a great fitted skirt but not too fit that I can't walk.I am very satisfied with my purchase. I will make another purchase in the future."
"Had the brown short sleeve one, which I loved! Only downside is the pocket ripped open after one wash. Regardless, just had a baby so decided to order the long sleeve dress, since the cut is forgiving ....They sent me another short sleeve one, SO bummed out!!!"
"Real garbage, don't bother to buy. I do not know where they get these Pantone numbers from but few printers know whats published in these booklets. It is next to impossible to look up a color. I suggest you buy the real chip books from Pantone."
"I've got a Wii and PS2, and this beats both.The graphics aren't great, but the accuracy is good and this game is ADDICTING.I hardly ever play video games, but I love this one because you can move around and test your shooting skills."
So cute! One never worked...sounded like something was broken as there was a rattling sound. Second worked for two days. I know they are solar. They have been in natural sunlight and light in an office. Still broken. Don't buy.
"This thing is awesome. Dont buy a regular lint roller just get this! You never have to spend time peeling layers off. Literally just roll the dog hair off of your yoga pants, rinse it in the sink, put it to dry, and repeat! haha"
"Purchased for $2.99 as an add on and even though its simple and transforms into a dinosaur rather than a car; my twins love it.  Sturdy toy for my 4yr olds to play with.  Wish it would transform a bit more, but ok as is for now."
"this is the perfect pant for women who dont have alot of curves! very flattering look & so comfortable & stylish! i love the quality,look & feel of these pants.more for shorter legged people.im 5'4"" & the length was perfect!"
Very nice pet bed for my cat and I got the small one which is a perfect size for her. Originally just got it to see if my cat would actually like it and it turned out really nicely. Only downside is that it comes with no washing instructions.
"My ferrets love this. They run through it and wrestle. Sometimes one of them even sleeps in it. I absolutely love it. Though I agree with whoever left the review, it changes after you wash it. The coloring on the shell does come off in the dryer."
"The socks are cute, and the size is just fine. But they don't stretch when you're pulling them on. I keep hearing a tearing noise when I try to pull them over my heel as gently as possible. Pretty sure they're going to fall apart quickly."
"This dress would've been perfect, except the gathers were unflattering.  If you have ""generous"" hips, the gathers greatly exaggerate them :-(  Otherwise, the fabric is light and comfortable, but not saggy or see-through.  Wish it could have worked for me."
"This has been a great toy for my dog, it is a bit heavy, but the rubber is still gentle on my dogs mouth and floors. My sisters larger dog was a bigger fan, but she will eat anything so I kept it for my own dog."
This product met my expectation that I can have a permanent marker in every room of the house. I use small pails or watering cans for kids and pencils for secretarial supplies wherever needed. These work fine and are priced for one within reach throughout the house.
This is perfect to keep the clutter off the coffee table and around the tv. I specially got this so my daughter doesn't have easy access to the remote controls in the living room. I was it stood a little taller in length. Could be used for many different things.
Assembled under 3 min flat. Perfect width to get all those small boxes organized and tuck away neatly in small space. Bonus is all the little hooks to hang items. Don't think meant for frequent moving around - fantastic to store in one place.
"These stay on better than any other diapers that I have tried on my 14 yr old pug. It was difficult to find a diaper that would stay on a pug that is paralysed from the waist down, but these work. I recommend them."
"Added water and turned nob, the bottle leaked and it only provided a very small amount of water even when holding the button. It's unfortunate that it doesn't work as advertised as this would have been a great tool for my puppy when out for a long walk."
"They are very functional.  I'm not wild about the color / finish of them, but otherwise, they are the perfect solution if you have a metal front door with side lights.  It's much better than trying to drill holes for curtains to cover the side lights."
"I have used the MF3110 for several years and have enjoyed the laser printing qualities.However, I just bought a new computer with Win 7 (64 bit) and per conversation Canon thisprinter will not run with this OS, nor do they plan to update the drivers."
"I was seeking realistic coins for use in a classroom environment. These coins are wonderful. Typical play money is not the same, nor is viewing the coins on paper. We use these coins along with a coin and conversion poster (for quick reference) when doing a rewards based classroom store."
"love this! bought it for my friend who graduated college. Specifically bought it for her as I had one when I would go on job interviews, write down interview times and specifics along with some helpful tips and hints for the interview process. It is pocket sized and adorable"
"We love these stickers.  They are great for little gifts, we put them in the Little Free Libraries on our street and my kiddo puts them on her water bottle.  They seem to hold up during washing and are sticky."
"Make a blue deck with this card, Lightning greaves, and Tinker. My friends wont even let me play it anymore lol. Add a few Counter spells and a Tularian Acadamy just to seal the victory and this card becomes the cornerstone to your unbeatable deck."
My Quaker parrot is kind of picky and a lot of new stuff scares him but he went right in this little nest and seems to like the top of it as well as the inside. The material is easy to clean off.
"Real review is my fur baby likes them. The reason I didn't give it a higher rating is due to the large amount of waste at the bottom of the bag. Alot is just dust like. As long as my girl likes them, she'll keep getting them."
"I rec'd these 4/23; it is now 6/1 and I have used them only a (literal) handful of times. They are stored upside down (marker down) with the caps on tightly and upon opening them this morning to use, all but the blue is dead."
I first found this toothpaste at a farmacia in the Fiumicino airport in Rome.  It works so well to clean teeth and leave your mouth super fresh.  Definitely worth the splurge as a little goes a long way.
"This is a great idea poorly executed. It does not even raise my neck enough to allow it to flex backwards and remain in that position. The crown of my head it’s the floor. Simply put, there is no “traction“ position."
Omg I just got this set and I LOVE IT!!!  It came way early and it is so comfortable. I love the material and the colors are great  I like it so much I just ordered another set. I highly recommend this seller and the outfits.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Stars all around.
"I like these Beekeepers Naturals B.Soothed Peppermint Honey Cough Drops-Organic Sore Throat Relief Lozenges. They have natural ingredients, like propolis, peppermint, honey. The amount of sugar is low. Also it is a source of Vitamin D and Zinc. The taste is fresh, sweet and refreshing."
I have a 22 year old toco toucan still going strong on this food . So happy to find it in 2lb bag! for years I only found 15lb bags . Item arrived 7 days before scheduled delivery as well . Thank you great seller
"I bought this collar for my female German shepherd and have received many compliments about the design.  My shepherd is an escape artist when using a normal buckle or adjustable collar but with this martingale collar, she has never been able to slip out of it."
"Some of the letters had incorrect numbers. I know the French set has different values. This was more like the print didn’t take.. The Z should have been a 10 but it only had a 1 on it.They refunded my money immediately, so three stars. :)"
"The pads are very well made, chemical and dye free. I use them for daily liner pads. I wish they were infused with cooling herbs- aloe, mint, rose and lavender. It does have an antiviral herb. Anyway great product. Fast shipping, good customer service!"
I love them. decent quality and the lenz's are pure and not &#34;dissimilar&#34; ...... DO NOT hurt eyes. I have previously purchased from another vendor on Amazon but will stick with this supplier. Thevfour colors are cool for an OLD personnthat I am.
"Does not properly remove lint, if at all.  Cover for batteries does not close.  Had to use rubber bands.  I end up using scissors to remove lint because this item does not operate to do that.  Very disappointing."
"I bought it as a gift for my cat-crazy daugher, but an adult friend of mine who saw it ordered one for herself as well, and placed it on the mantlepiece because ""it's so pretty"", so yeah, it makes a great gift for all cat lovers :)"
"Ray-Bans have glass lenses and these are plastic so, not a good replacement. They fit alright but, not perfect. Sometimes they pull an eyebrow hair because of the gap between the lens and frame. For the money, I was expecting glass lenses and better quality."
"Beatiful, simple and a celebration of the ever present Coca-Cola in our lives.12 different pics linked all by smiling girls and a tempting glass of Coke. The quality is really good and the calendar itself looks like it can hold its own for a whole year hanging from the wall."
Returned this game. The photos of the game showed joker tiles and mission tiles. The box did not include them. The only differences between this and the regular version are the much higher price and the acrylic facade pieces. Disappointed.
"Va Va Va Voom!  These worked great on my honey, and then she even used them on me...  They aren't too big, just the right size for comfortable use and fun...  We will probably order more, maybe in different colors..."
Don’t buy was not the doll picture mine came on with a head bashed in  and it wasn’t at all what the picture shown it to be.  I was able to send my back to get a refund .  Buyers beware.
I use alot of envelopes in my business and find it hard to place legal size folders inside if it has very many pages.  I find the need to cut my folders off about a 1/2 inch to make it easier for in & out.
"This is a no-nonsense lip cream that works well for the cold winter nights. I put it on before bed to give my lips a bit of relief. There are no frills, no cute packaging, no fun flavors, but it gets the job done."
"Love the dress fits great, I have my measurements and it made to order, absolutely love the back of the dress it's like a corset looks nice and can be adjusted it needed, the fabric is very soft makes the dress comfortable to wear, very happy with purchase"
I didn't realize that these bags were plastic which makes them very durable!  The kids loved receiving these filled with fun favors!  My only complaint is that they are a little shorter than I thought but they still worked great!
I love this and wear it all the time! comfortable and you can wear it a couple of different ways. I also bought it because my daughters high school colors are green and white and I wear it to her volleyball games! Hats are coming back!!
I was supposed to get a rebate from uberzon for this and they never did. Would only be worth it if I actually got the rebate. Not worth it. Wish I could return it but it’s out of its return window.
"The wheels are great seem very sturdy amd good finish. I thought the tires were going to be factory size of the models listed since there is no tire size listed beyond 1.9. Disppointed that I ""saved"" by bundling but really wasted money on tires I didnt want"
Love the nail cutter for the fake tips and the cuticle pushers. Best cuticle pusher/ nails tools I’ve ever gotten. The only thing I don’t really like are the nippers because it doesn’t have the grip point I’m looking for but does an ok job. WORTH IT FOR THE PRICE.
"I’ve had it for few months now and haven’t had any issues with mold or cracking. The bristles are made of some silicone but it feels great when I use it in the shower. I think it helps stimulate hair growth too, great products"
"Almost every time I order these 1 of the 3 malfunctions.  They are cheap, so I continue to order them, and in the past when I've complained the company sends a replacement cartridge.  It's just annoying that you can't purchase anything of good quality anymore."
"totally love these socks, and have given them as a gift, too. they shrunk in the dryer, but stretched out on my feet without losing their shape. i wear a women's 9, and ordered the small, which fit well after many washings."
"I love the colors I love the sticky tab. I love the quantity, but I do not like the paper. It is very weak. I was hoping it would be more sturdy feels like a cheap printer paper, easy to tear but there’s plenty of them for the price."
"Lamp arrived DOA. Packaging showed no damage, but the lamp showed signs of previous use. Bulb was loose in the package.I have ordered a replacement bulb. Hopefully that solves my problem.Installed new verilux bulb. Still doesn't work.  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SITE."
They look just as cute in person. And once you get them on they are comfortable. But there are a lot of random strings in there so putting them on my toe gets hung sometimes-but once they are on I’m happy-especially for the discounted price
I have used this product before so I was happy to find a refill on Amazon.  We mainly use this on carpet where our lovely dog has repeatedly peed on.  It works really well and I would recommend to anyone.
I am not actually a nurse but this clip on version is so easy to use. I work in a deli and I clip the watch at the top of my apron right under my name badge where it fits perfectly and I can read it easily.
Sending back.  This thing pulled my beard hair like crazy. Also I can't get a couple of the attachments to clip on.  I see some other people have the same issues so the quality control must be no good.
"My names are up on my fish tank while I still am searching for baby names for future add ons to my tank, this quality product displays the list fantastically! All in all a great time saving and hassle free improvement to my home."
Two stars because of the shoe part of the usb but the usb itself kept coming out and the usb couldn’t be flashed to be pulled up so I ended up cutting my old usb and glued it into the shoe
"My husband is an engineer.  He can fix anything or put anything together.  He said the directions for this cabinet totally suck.  There are photos that don't really show anything, no words, and the drawers are actually metal that is folded.  He said ""stupid Chinese crap"""
Really nice collar- Love the design Jolly Roger is awesome.the closure is holding up well and I do not forsee any issues with it.Very timely delivery- all in all I am pleased with the collar- exactly what it says it is.
[[VIDEOID:69ba79a4c36efb456ad94c0083605db6]] They were a hit at my daughters glow party. She was turning 7. The only think I disliked is that two headbands came broken! So couldn’t use them. The adults like them too lol. The glasses you can’t see out of because the lines but they make cute props.
Careful to check when you get them. Says you need two packages for a complete set. But the tread isn't perfectly centered. So there needs to be left and right sides for the tires. All four were exactly the same. The foams were pretty horrible too. Too stiff
The pop came in not too great condition. The protection box was placed on it backwards with not much care. It was also dirty inside the protection case. It’s a good thing I bought more protective sleeve. Funko is in pretty good condition. Just everything else wasn’t.
"Compass accuracy is affected when bracelet is closed because the metal, fire starter is magnetized.  The fire starter produces a very weak spark and I doubt would be of any use in starting a fire. Other than the whistle, it’s just a piece of rope."
LOVE this top.  I normally wear a large and bought a large- I wonder if I’ll order another one in a medium due to slightly fitting bigger.  It’s very flatting.  I’m 5’9 and as for the length- it will work with leggings- but barely.
I used to own the same hat in the picture. The hat and the skateboard were both light forest green. I lost the hat and wanted to replace it. This one is dark green with a black skateboard. Not what is pictured.
"Works well with the (100) White 1-3 Vinyl 12&#34; Record Cardboard Multi-Depth Mailers. The mailers can hold up to 5 albums with out these. But, if you're shipping less, then these are the professional choice for protecting your customer's goods."
"I had a stud in my new cartilage piercing and it was too short and my ear started to grow around it, so I bought this and my ear is perfectly healed. Easy to put in, and I love that it’s seamless and you can’t see the clasp."
"Very happy with shingles, well made and well packaged.  Have applied most of them to a cat barn roof and very happy with consistency and workability of shingles.  Used hot melt glue to fix them and they went on quickly and easily."
"Came with a little ding in it which I was upset about but honestly the packaging was really really good and the board is amazing for the $110 or so price.  If you are looking at it, just get it"
"Product is great quality but runs rather large.  My daughter is almost 9 months old and typically fits into 6-9 month clothes, this 3-6 month was HUGE on her.  We returned the 3-6 month size and reordered a 0-3 month size, which fits perfectly."
The item was greatly priced compared to the stores. The only problem I have is how thing they are making the filters now. I may have to buy another brand and I have had this one for over 20 years. Greed can sometimes destroy a company. WORDS FOR THOUGHT.
Does not work as well as Advantage II on our dogs. Advantage II knocks fleas out in one treatment and they stay off for 3 months. This stuff... not so much. And it's more expensive to boot. Going back to Advantage.
"Simple to use, no frills but gets the job done. You just need to add 2 AAA batteries. Can't beat the price and the light is bright, magnifier decent, it really helps me to identify if an office is needed."
The color are great! Good quality and I get so many compliments at work! They are very affordable and stylish! 10/5 I would definitely recommend any headband from this company! This is my 3rd set and I’ll be buying more!
"Loved this product, just reordered it. I use it twice a day and it is amazing, so easy to use. Love the whiter teeth, it makes you want to smile continually. Definitely recommend this for anyone wanting a brighter, whiter smile."
If you have a toddler don’t buy this. I could not let my baby play with this because the end was so sharp. I was scared he was going to stab her in the face with it. It’s cute I guess but I regret buying it.
"This tea tree cream is an essential that every home should have, it’s an antiseptic it’s good to place after you get a cut or rash, and can be used to soothe the skin after Waxing any part of your body, I highly recommend it!"
"Found a piece broken after assembly, the stability and sturdiness wasn't so good. I would like to send it back and get my money back for this item. I found it not to be what I expected from the pictures I seen on the site"
"I was a bit hesitant with so many reviewers saying they came apart, but all of mine were stitched together fine, and made it through a full school day with junior highers wearing them!  I wrote on them with glitter fabric paint for our Halloween costume contest."
"What a great calendar!  It really focuses on Schitt's Creek on different scenes and characters from the show.  I love the crisp, focused images from the show throughout, and the layout of the calendar.  It's a fun calendar and perfect for all Schitt's Creek fans!"
These shells are beautiful and a great range of sizes! I had one of my hermit crabs switch shells overnight (just placed the shells in the crabitat last night wow!) for the first time! Shipped quickly! Thank you so much will purchase again in the future! Highly recommend!
"Got these for my tiny mini dachshund puppy, because she can get under foot, but cannot hear two of the three bells and barely hear the third one.  Not worth the price.  Could have gone to Dollar Tree to find something better."
"I loved my tag for about a week and a half. It is really heavy keeps pulling my top down and then broke when I went to swip in. Pulled out and just stayed. Then the face popped off. So disappointed, its so cute."
very pink. Not as much as expected when looking at the online picture. Very cute on. But tight on me and not exactly what i needed at the time. Peachy Pink base with red burgundy flowers. Pretty but more pink than expected when you search for WHITE party dresses.
I gave it 4 stars because I ordered 3.25 & was sent 3.0 But I had ordered a pair through amazon from another manufacturer and they were horrible but I love these THEY ARE PERFECT!! I would tell anyone that I am really happy with them!
I made the powder into size O capsules and take 2 with 2 chamomile size O capsules on nights where sleep is elusive. This combination helps me get a great natural sleep with no hang over or drugged out effect in the morning.
"I got bored of playing around with my standard Rubik's cube, so I bought this. It's very fun to solve the puzzle spatially, opposed to the traditional color cube.Great for someone who likes solving Rubik's cubes. Provides a challenge, but one that's doable!"
This is a great game. I use it in my kindergarten classroom. It has several levels of play to teach a variety of skills. This game is used so much that I just bought a new one to replace my old worn out game.
"Follow directions, cleans much better than vinegar,especially if you have a stainless carafe, and soooo easy. No more vinegar smell. You only run a couple of cycles after using it! Coffee pot like new. If you use gold permanent instead of paper filters, it cleans it as well"
I bought this for my boys which are teenagers. They really liked the idea of this float however it is kind of small. My boys are close to 6' and the float is a bit to small for them. This didn't keep them from using it.
"Received these earrings, I did not see a silver 925 stamp on these, but seem to be pretty good.  I have worn them for a few weeks now and don’t have any problems with them.  Not seeing any peeling or chipping from the gold plating."
This was a gift for a child with severe SID.  She LOVES this toy.  She does not touch many things but this is something she loves to touch.  This toy is giving her great joy and laughter with her parents.
"The Efficascent oil relieves pain in most areas ,use in on the area of a total knee replacement and it does a very good job allows me to sleep.I have used it on my back as well as my stomach and it always does the job."
"I love these! They are flexible and very comfortable. I had some 3D printed ones before but they kept breaking in my purse. Since these are rubber, they bend and flex, not breaking in my purse! Thank you! They're great for keeping the mask straps off my ears"
Just squeeze it on and let it do its thing. Wipe around after a few minutes and wait a couple more then rinse it off to a shiny nice clean bathtub. Love this product. Where was this stuff all my life?
"Fantastic invention!!! I have a 17 year old Chihuahua who uses potty pads. I recently moved to an apartment and wanted something more “attractive”. This not only LOOK better than a regular potty pad, but I’m finding it conceals the pee odor as well!!"
Came out exactly as pictured. It is a bit pricey. You can find singing cards that are the same price. Thick material so it doesn’t tear or bend easily. Which is a great thing. Overall I’m happy with the purchase.
"We have an aging female cat that is has cancer. She loves this food and continues to hang in there since we added it to her diet. I am not saying this food is extra special, but it is working for us at this time."
I’ve tried several vibrators and this is the only one that comes close to my favorite model.  Many say they have powerful motors and barely vibrate but this one really does.  Definitely worth getting.  The price can’t be beat.
The cats love it. That alone is enough for me. The overall system takes about 5 mins to setup. Just a few sticks and sliding them together with connectors. The suction cups are holding great even with it being really cold outside and warm inside.
"Great toy, lasted longer than I expected.  Most last a few hours but this one lasted a day, then bought again and it lasted a week.  (To some that sounds crazy but a week is a long time with these crazy chewers). Will continue to buy this product."
"My daughter loves them. Good variety to choose from and they hold onto the glasses tight but can be switched out easily to match her outfits. They're also soft and stretchy, made out of like a nerf water ball material, so they're comfortable and easy to clean too."
"Gloves were very low quality for this price, and in my case did not fit my middle schooler, so returned.  Bad experience with the return process from this seller, so if you do buy, I would recommend finding another seller to purchase from."
"Meet ZaaZaa, she is 5lbs, I ordered a medium size and it fits perfect. She loved her new jacket. It is well constructed, she was comfortable, and got lots of compliments. I received the item on time. I hope they put more items like this one out."
"I like that these cards are white white, not with a blue cast like some others.  Some of them don’t crease very nicely though, with the opposite side of the score looking a little ragged. Good enough quality for the price."
This worked great to keep my lab from &#34; bothering &#34; her back leg after surgery. It stayed on and did not seem to &#34;bother&#34; her while she was wearing it! She used it as a pillow when she she slept!
Well I thought I was prepared for any food a bearded dragon might eat. Certainly NOT this! I have never smelled anything so aweful in my life and I thought they would come as pictured on the can....... nope rotton moldy and black. Definitely will not be doing this again!
This is a very good dildo. It came with a little bit of a chemical spell that eventually went away. Good size for both oral and anal. Good for beginners. It’s silver in color.  It’s definitely fun something I would recommend.
"First time using one of these. Can't tell if it's helping my wrist, since I didn't have wrist problems to begin with, but it's comfortable and super cute. It's so comfortable and natural that it now feels weird when I'm working at computers without it."
This jump suit is so cute but it says wide legs and was like buying a Sml/medium.  I wear a medium to large size 12 5'8.5. Just to tight in legs.  So sad on this fit.  No give to the material at all.
"My dog has fairly bad skin allergies. I began giving her these chews a couple of months ago and have been really happy to see the condition improve moderately in conjunction with other measures (medicated shampoo, etc.) Definitely worth the price."
A bit of a cool sensation...that's it! Nothing like it describes! Waste of money! I asked for a refund & have been ignored by the seller! DON'T WASTE YOUR $$ HERE!  Bought a different product elsewhere & got amazing results! This stuff is a farce!
This shirt is very hard to see. I could not make out the people at all. I emailed the seller for a replacement back in December it is now February  and I never heard back from them. Please don't waste your money
"Paper was a perfect  fit on  my Sharp EL-1801V Portable 12-Digit 2-Color Compact Printing Calculator takes 2 1/4&#34; width.Good quality white paper I use everyday.I purchased exactly same item at a local Target store ( @ 2.49)  since price is high on Amazon,"
"My dog has skin problems, I used this to massage the dead skin and excess oils off her body then just washed her like normal and the difference it made made her less itchy and she smelled good for days longer than usual."
I like this product for the fact that they can be seen from across my classroom.  I wanted numbers with the dots on them to support my group that needed just a little extra help;  These are perfect.
"My dogs love these, and we've purchased two sets so far. Three of my dogs just love to carry them around, but I have a Corgi who loves to tear them apart. They take her a little while to get apart, so I'm thrilled about that."
Love this!!!!! My hair feels and looks amazing. It was doing pretty bad after multiple hair colorings and after just 2 days of use looks like I never colored.Edited: Stopped working a little over a month after purchase. Refuses to replace. Do not buy at this price.
The front of my planner is already scratched up and I've only been using it for about three days. Some of the pages at the top have already ripped. I'm thinking I just got a defective one. So sad because it is adorable.
"Purchased this to use on my thick coated cats. Very quiet, did the job, not quite the quality of more expensive brands but is certainly capable of holding up indefinitely with proper care. Easy to use and charge, battery life seems good."
If you have been a fan of the Deadpool movies then you have met Domino. Her mutant talent is luck. things just seem to always work out for her.this figure is very well sculpted. they have really captured the character in the figure.
"Only one if this price that's decent. The ugly snake in the front can be folded back to look like a generic 'gold' accent, which one s a relief, I was going to cut it off. There's also a small wire in it so it stays put."
"Smells horribly at first, though by two weeks of flipping it to the other side every day, or two it is usable now. Now to see if I can get the end corners to flatten better with some weight on them."
"Ordered the dress.  Received an email asking for measurements to be confirmed.  I didn't confirm my measurements, asked for the dress to be shipped.  I was told the dress would be MADE and couldn't not be returned simply because it didn't fit.Dress FINALLY arrived.  Too small!"
Ferrets love the taste. Place small amount on their belly while lying on their back on my thighs and they are so frantic licking it up they don’t realize I’m clipping their nails. Makes the job incredibly easy and it’s nutritional snack for them!
"I was having hand cramps from using a computer mouse all day at work. My PT had me using one of these to strengthen my hand. I got such great results, I found this one on Amazon to have one at home."
"DO NOT ORDER! This is a cheap knockoff and came from overseas. It is basically a piece of decorative paper glued inside a cheap, clear case.  The worst part is, the paper doesn't even run to the edge of the case. What a waste of money!"
"It's priced right; and it had good reviews. So, we bought it. It kept breaking as we were trying to seal the boxes. Agree with the other reviewer, and if I had it to do over again, I'd just buy Scotch instead."
"Being visually challenged it works pretty well. However,it could have been larger. It is small  and too lightweight could be easily broken. Despite the flaws of design cou can thread a needle without seeing so that is just fine."
"Whether you run a kennel, a grooming service, a veterinary service, or an animal shelter, this stuff makes a world of difference when it comes to keeping your place smelling fresh. And a little goes a loooooonnnng way if you use proper dilution ratios."
"This is an ok konjac sponge. Nothing thrilling, not exfoliating, more like gentle pad to wash your face or take off make up.Nice size (diameter of credit card), although rather thin. Supposingly handmade.~~~*FPN:^ advertised as natural and organic;^^ made in Korea."
"Bought for my daughter's night time bday party! The kids loved them and they lasted all night long. several were left on overnight and they still lasted and a few days later I found a few under my daughter's bed and the battery was STILL WORKING!!! Excellent value, excellent quality"
By going off the measurments I thought they would be a good size. But the package camed slightly damanged but there was an amzon sticker on the box saying it was okay and amzon certified. But when I went to have the blown up two of the balloons were damaged.
"My husband has Alzheimer’s and I need to make sure he doesn’t get constipated, which he has a tendency to do. I give him two of these a night, and it absolutely solves the problem. They are a little miracle."
"This is perfect for on the go scanning, or sitting on the corner of your desk. Easy 5 minute set-up and you are ready to scan anything. Love that is has the port right into your device for ease of printing or emailing. Awesome product!"
"These would have so much better with a non-slip bottom layer.  They slide around and bunch up under my arch, or slide back and climb up my heel. They crease and form sharp-hard parts when they bend.The cushioning is great, too bad the housing let me down."
This dark gray looks so nice on me! I as debating to choose xs or s and glad xs fits so well! I like the deep pockets! I can put my cell phone when I walk to set my hands free! Overall I am very happy with the purchase!
This restraint is perfect for keeping my dog safe in the car!I had to assemble it & there were no instructions! That was frustrating! But I figured out! I felt silly not knowing how to put it together! But it made sense after I figured it out!It’s really nice!
"I love  this product.  I have been taking it for a few years  Vitamin K plus Vitamin D  is recommended.  However, I ordered 6 bottles which should have gotten me through June, 2022.  They all expire in 12/21. Buyer beware."
"In typical toddler fashion, my little brother wouldn’t leave the hat on, but the costume was still so cute! It fit perfectly and it was soft and fit well enough that he wasn’t uncomfortable in it at all. He got so many compliments!"
"The product will definitely keep my mouth closed but it’s rough, itchy and I assume i’ll wake up with some sort of chin rash. It is intended to be worn on the face. They couldn’t come up with any fabric softer than this?????"
"the printer is a great printer but it does not print double sides from copy.  All my previous HP Officejets printed both side wheter printing or copying a real disappointment. Prints from my phone or laptop with no problem, great office printer except for not copying on both sides!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
These are fantastic for keeping track of the registration paperwork on trailers that get pulled by multiple vehicles.  Big enough to hold a couple of spare bulbs to if you have issues with them always being blown on your trailer too.
Really happy with this purchase. I wanted a basic sponge that exfoliated my skin while in the shower and this gets the job done! I also really like the handy suction cup that way I can hang it in the shower.
This does its job for my 18 month old daughter’s leg cast. It is very tight and uncomfortable for her to wear so we have to make it very quick in and out of the bath or shower. The cast has remained dry for several uses now.
These gave my dog terrible diarrhea.  My dog is 30# and I even split it in half.  I would definitely not recommend these.  Not sure why these would cause the upset but I won't be buying them again.
"This is a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be. But, it is just a basic doll. Clothes do come off, and the eyes do not move. Fits great in toddler hands. The clothes are very soft and cute."
"Cute pen but So disappointed.  Once you remove the rubber stopper from the ball point, the ink will dry out in several days. I just purchased these and am unable to use it because there are no ink left."
"its okay but no pockets, no buttons, really a duster. i should have looked more closely at the description, my bad. Thias would not fit comfortably over another sweater.  would not be warm enough alone. i may return it on Monday, i haven't made up my mind yet."
This oven set is so cute. It looks exactly like the pictures and the sounds are very realistic. They are loud and the fire lights up. There are different noises for when the stovetop is sizzling and the oven is roasting.
"I have this from years ago,but I'm getting low,just put it in my cart.I love this brand,the Gel pens go on it very smooth.It has a nice heavy old time feel that the other,cheaper brands don't quite get.The colors are a nice rich hue"
"my dog really enjoys these treats. he's always eager for another one we tried several different varieties he seems to like them all  I like the fact that they're made of human grade ingredients,  makes me feel good about what I'm  giving him."
The sizing is not even close to what is listed.  The shirt has pads which I missed in the description also.  This would be ok if they were anywhere close to where my chest actually is.  A total return.
"Since my condo doesn’t have space to hang a regular size calendar, I’ve been purchasing these planners for 19 years! They are a lifesaver for someone so calendar dependent and can be hung via clip to any metallic surface. The Cannot/would not be without!"
"I bought this for a coworker who is a salty dog down to his core. He even lives on a sailboat. He absolutely adores this and uses it every day, to look at the mountain range across the Puget Sound."
"There was nothing to dislike about this top. I purchased this top to wear with a flirty skirt. I was flying to visit a good friend for dinner. It fit well, washed well and I am very happy with my purpose"
Package has been opened and resealed. All of the cards are about the worst you can get. Not a single one worth more than a dollar. I didnt read any reviews before purchasing and wish I would have. Looks like a lot of people got scammed as well
"As most phones of this type support headsets, I assumed this one did.  I was incorrect in that assumption.  Additionally could not find an expansion handset, thought there might be one that supported a head set.  None available."
"Really didn't last long before getting a small air leak at the bulb. Not a major issue, but it does slow the speed of the siphoning action. I really am trying to find a good solution. Anybody got any better product selections?"
"5 minutes out of the box and the tail snaps right off. I had to super glue it on twice now, hope I don't have to do it a third time. This toy is cheap and poorly designed! Don't waste your money and have a sad dissappointed child."
I really love the smell. Can use just a half of one per bath. I’m not a big fan of the small ones as I don’t like peppermint. I was not aware that’s why they were tiny is because the sent is so strong.
"very small, an thus its not very powerful.  i had to do some finagling and found that it would not pump water into another location at too great of an angle... so it worked but not as well as i had hoped."
I want to feed my cats organic food as they have bad allergies to so much. They wouldn't even lick this food so perhaps they are spoiled but that is the only way I can rate this product by their reaction to it.
It’s a cool idea but the mesh hits right against my puppy’s throat which concerns me for his breathing. I found that I had to keep my hand under his butt the whole time to keep his head above the mesh part .
These are very pretty rainbow/chakra pendant points.  It seems to me that the color is almost too perfectly colored to be natural.  and they are nice large points just as in the photo.  I really do like them!
"Product as described.  As others have mentioned, the scent is more akin to a walk in the woods than a Christmas Fur in the living room, but it does lack the heavier handed disinfectant tinge of other types and it gives a nice mild foresty scent to the room."
"We’ve tried many snacks/treats for our Golden Doodle and nothing compares to these treats. Simple, yet beneficial ingredients for our growing two year old pup. I love how I can break them up and share them with his other furry friends, big or small. Highly recommended!"
"Got a new pair of golf shoes that run a little large and thus got heel blisters the first round I walked in them.  After using these, the fit is more snug and comfortable and I'm no longer getting blisters."
"Im always skeptical to buy something that ecensuates my loneliness, however; as I wrestle in the shower scrubbing much more than my back with it, removing blemishes I cannot reach alone. Pondering maybe I won't be so lonely after using it.TLDR Would strongly recommend for those with similar lifestyles."
"I Like the different shapes of these. Remove easily and reattach if you decide to use on something else. The chalk pen included did not work, it was dried up. I had one I had purchased from a craft store here at the house, so I used it."
Super soft cover that fits nice and snug but not too tight.  You can remove this cover easily if needed.  This cover makes the Maxi Rub massager more gentle when lying against your skin.  No rough edges.
"My granddaughter loves Mickey and Minnie Mouse, so she truly loves this outfit.  It fits her perfectly, with a little room for growth, but I don't mind that at all.  It is very cute and she has received a lot of compliments!"
My son and I have had a lot of fun with this little copter. We've both enjoyed remote control vehicles in the past but being able to see from the perspective of the vehicle is awesome and the pictures and video is of fairly good quality.
"These are awesome for the dogs.  They can see so much better.  only negative is they run through batteries, but it could be because I go on long hikes and it's really cold - doesn't cold drain batteries?"
"Super cute pool float. We got this more for the effect, rather than to actually float on, but after a while we started to lay in the pool on it. It held up well, and it’s adorable, so it’s a win win."
Not the easiest to assemble but not too hard either. Instructions are well documented to make it as easy as possible. This makes much better use of the box. The way the trays are designed and hold the tokens and extra parts is fenominal. Really good design.
I have purchased wrist blood pressure monitors in the past. The last one from a different company was very good. It is no longer available. I switched to this one. It is comfortable and easy to use. The concern is it is very inconsistent. This is not consistently accurate.
"On the first use of this bat hitting waffle balls, the handle tore and came loose from the handle. Had to use some electrical tape to get it back together. The bat portion works well, and the size of the bat is good."
"I wanted a pet lion as a little boy, and now...! This is awesome for silly picture time! Both my dogs let me put it on them and to my amazement were uncharacteristically tolerant of wearing this for my amusement"
"I have liked Lip Ivo for many years, since my roommate in college introduced me to it and I snagged hers all the time.  I wish they had an SPF version, but I have other lip balms for that."
I'm not impressed with this kit at all. The scissors are very stiff and aren't easy to use. So far I haven't been able to loosed them. The wooden comb is very awkward to use. And the brush is just ok.
"The control for this light is electronic; so unplugging it resets the control.  If you unplug is or try to use it with a timer, it defaults to ""Off"".  If you want to manually turn it on, and adjust the brightness or color, it works fine."
"This was a very pretty skirt. I got the black, thinking it had lighter stripes, but it turned out to be sparkly silver. I liked it, but I bought it for work, so it was a little fancy for that. The fit was nice, and I liked the length."
"Worked great for a modified SCX24, I would suggest maybe getting a variety pack pack length size instead. Although it filled it's purpose I may have to add 2 extension together if trying to run lights to the back of rc car."
"One of thee best sh figuarts... the packaging is amazing its like a small cell phone box. And it comes with a concept art book. The paint is exelent ... high quality , high end sh figuarts figure of the year!"
I bought this for a little girl turning 6. It's sweet and adorable. She loves my maltipoo so and she was delighted when she opened it. She ran over to thank me so I would say it's definitely giftable and a good value.
"Pretty but it’s not a dress, it’s a tunic. My ass would hang out if I wore it as a dress, it’s extremely short and I’m 5’2”. It was very loose. I’ll probably take it in some otherwise it has no shape."
"My grandson loves them and use them for the amazing robots he he loves to build.  He was always bummed because there weren't enough flexible joints in the sets , so I found these and he builds for hours then plays with them for hours. He is 8."
"I scared the hell out a buddy of mine at work, he hates snakes. I put this in his desk, and the rest was how I pictured it would be. He could get away from his desk fast enough. Too funny! Very realistic rubber snake."
"this ', ostensibly made by , was delivered last tuesday and i have to say that i'm using it almost daily. i wish it was more like a ; in terms of appearance but i'm happy enough. good for the price."
"It comes with a pad of flimsy paper to rip off sheets for the scavenger hunt, the crayons and stickers packet is pretty small… I’m going to have to add things to this bag to make it any good… A little disappointing"
This book display stand is so pretty! It will definitely take your book displaying to another level. I’ve been seeing it on interior design pages and decided to buy one. It made of a beautiful shiny black plastic or acrylic and it is just beautiful!
"Adorable. I used these to cover my baby's cast for her clubfoot. It not only made the cast cuter by matching it to her clothes, but also helped keep it clean from spitup and diaper leaks, plus made it softer for her other leg to run against it."
"Absolutely in L♥️VE with my necklace! The flashlight effect is for sure the cherry on top! Great news is, I can rock it every day and not break out! The material is legit, and has this beautiful sparkle to it that can’t help but catch eyes!"
The inner pouch makes the bag much smaller than it is and it has a weird odor.  Was not aware that I had such a short window to return this bag.  It is already sitting in the giveaway pile.
"The Vendor claimed that this case would fit a Tandem T:slim 2x it didn't the on/off switch on the T:slim 2x is on the opposite side of where the cases raised indentation is located, couldn't turn the device on or off with the case on, will be returning the case."
"These figures are great and extremely detailed, but there are a couple issues. The biggest is that Harry's eyes are blue rather than green which is a fairly big mistake. Second, I threw the stand out with the packaging because I didn't realize it was in there."
"I am in love with this microfiber  mop, is easy for my to clean the fans now I am a very short person.  I love that came with several replacements towels.  The material is a high quality."
"Recieved it today, I had my daughter wear it and it's too big. I should have gotten her size (6yr) but I got a size bigger, so I'm sending it back. Overall the design of the jacket is cute. The material of the jacket is a cheap leather like material."
This product simply does not work. At all. In the slightest. It's a useless piece of plastic. I bought it and tried it once and then it went in the garbage. More plastic for the landfill. This company should be charged with fraud.
"The magnet cards are high quality & great for the rigors of classroom use.  Magnetic letters are not included, but standard sized letters will work.  I bought more upon seeing the quality of them.  I use them for a blended learning activity."
"Great selection of a variety of sizes of bars.  Unfortunately the repair tool was missing.  Luckily I have one already and I mostly bought it for the bars.  My watch is fixed, plus I have extra bars.  So it's good!"
"Nice fit- more fitted than it appears in the picture but not tight- just enough to give shape. The neck is higher than I anticipated but it looks nice with a long necklace. Comfortable. Fabric is a little funny feeling, but not bad."
I loved getting rid of all my mismatched desk accessories and getting these classy matching ones. I want to get more sets as gifts for graduating high schoolers in my family and church who are going off to college. Sturdy items at a great price!
"My son got this for me and him as we enjoy wooden puzzles...HOLY HELL! Either we've gotten worse or this sucker is hard to put together. Adorable concept..we can't get passed the second stage. It doesn't fit, even with sanding..but I'm going to blame user error instead of the product:)"
"This took about maybe 45 minutes to put together. The instructions were clear and all the tools were provided. It's wide enough for large monitors, and controls. It is sturdy enough to stay put and support most things. This is a great dorm room table."
"The watch runs and works well, it needed a watch battery, no big deal.Battery you will need:SR626SW / AG4 377EDIT: 1/6/19, I downgraded the rating to a 1/5 from 5/5 cuz the battery cover cannot be placed back.  Useless."
"The drone is great, but when I used Drone Deploy with it, it was hijacked by the app and the drone was simply gone ... Bought another, but drone deploy never again. I was warned by another folk who the same thing had happen to. Should have trusted him."
"Don't really know how deep ya can go with rating a badge holder, all I can say it's what I needed, seems decent. Holds my ID's for work , I'll probably grab a few more in case this one falls apart, for the price you can't go wrong"
This was really cute for a craft project with my boys. Only thing I didn't like was that you can't really use it. The hold in the front is no where near big enough for birds to get in and get food out. It was still fun though.
"Great and inexpensive terry bath rove. I was looking for a terry cloth robe and found this one.  It is NOT one of those extremely thick robes you get at fancy hotels, etc, but it does the job and washes well and doesn't cost that much."
"Ordered on a Monday, received on Wednesday. Initially shocked that inner plastic bag leaked into outer bag fish pressed with little water and gasping. Released into pond and they swimmed merrily around. Weeks later all fish healthy and active and a BEAUTIFUL assortment. Ordered 6, they sent 7. Highly recommend"
"Does a great job on both the face and head.  Heads are inexpensive to replace and last quite a while.  My last shaver, a Norelco, was good too, but the heads were more expensive than the shaver.  Recommended."
"This jacket is nice, great quality and you can dress it up or down but, I ordered a large when I actually could’ve gotten a medium so I end up returning it but, I am going to reorder it in a medium."
"It’s a great concept, easy to open cartons (like kids milk carton only bigger) I think the scent is strong like lemongrass and clove and not like orange. I’m sure it’s wonderful, ending up gifting to friends, smell was just not my favorite. Will definitely try another scent! Great company!"
I bought this for a puppy so it was a bit large for him so I cut it in half to fit around his neck. I will definitely rebuy again when he grows some more. I’ve already washed it and it has held up well!
I love that these are individually wrapped to keep them fresh in the zip loc bag that they come in.  The fur kids were immediately taken to them.  I now have three happy kids gnawing on their treats.
Came with miss matched pieces directions where very difficult to follow being everything was in metric. Do not buy this spend an extra $20 for something better. I’m waiting for this thing to fall apart I am very disappointed in this purchase
There was a tag but it’s been cut out. And where ever this dress came from it smells like ferrets lived there also.The ruching of the dress is all the way down which feels…. Odd. It looks better in the picture.
"besides getting the card 24 hours after i was given a guaranteed delivery & getting it after my sisters graduation, the displayed picture of the card looks more matte and a lot better on the screen than it does in real life."
"The seams look hastily put together, and look like they were made very quickly. Bag is stiff and the plastic mesh can be easily chewed through which is not safe for animals. I recommended buying a animal safe bag off of Etsy."
"Perfect for a card table. Just the right texture of material to easily slide the tiles. Had been using a table cloth prior to buying this. Will never go back to cloth again! If you play MJ, you need this!"
"I found running water over it under the tap to work best to wet it and then wait 30-45 seconds to make sure it's saturated before applying.  Press firmly and evenly over the entire transfer, then remove the paper.  Oil works great to dissolve it!"
"Very thin, but have not in fact leaked or torn yet. Used for compostable waste in a garage-based 6 gal pail. Barely tall enough & not wide enough for that pail. Strong enough, though, to stretch around the top without tearing badly. Good price for such a generous pkg."
It came with a missing part. A crucial missing part bc the part missing won’t allow the band to connect with the watch. The metal connector didn’t come on one of the bands and the bands seemed really slim too. More feminine.
"The most uniform,  spherical substrate i could find.  The price isn't that bad.  It took two 11 lb bags to fill both an innovative marine 14 peninsula and innovative marine 10 fusion tanks with a 2.5 inch bed.  See pics on setup day."
"These are beautiful!!! I received these as a gift, an I have been searching for them online. Finally found the exact card with the Dartford Warbler on the front. Can be used for any occasion, and will put a smile on the recipient's face. I highly recommend them."
Love these BIC PrevaGuard stic ballpoint pens. I have always loved BIC pens. Long lasting and smooth writing. I appreciate that the surface has an antimicrobial agent on it. Great pens for note taking or for drawing. Smooth and no blobs of ink on the paper. Great pens.
I liked everything about  it with one little exception. One of the drawers sticks. Not a big deal. If it bothers me a little sandpaper will fix it. It came very well packaged and on time. Yes I would  recommend this product.
"Cats enjoy it and get there treats but it is pretty easy to get them out.  If you try to adjust the size opening, it then won't allow any treats to come out.  So it needs to be fully open which results in easy access for the cats."
"My dog is 20 lbs, strong chewer, but not exactly a big dog. These come two to a pack...gave him the first one this morning - destroyed in ten minutes. Gave him the second one a few minutes ago. Well, the photo says it all."
"This was perfect for our baby's Halloween costume.  The color is exactly as pictured.  The tie isn't very long, so I wasn't worried about choking.  My baby liked the silky feel of the fabric.  It is definitely sized for a baby, toddler, or small child."
I purchased this for my grandson’s 1st birthday. Arms had weak spots which we had to repairWith tape.  Big holes along the seams. Feet air holes almost glued shut. Had to gently open to use. Quality control non existent. Would not recommend. Certainly not worth the $.
These colors that I purchase did not end up being pastel colors. Yellow ended up being a green.  Pink ended up being a very dark purple.  The pastel Orange ended up being a very dark Orange.  Only the pastel purple pastel green and gray were correct colors.
This was a great way for me to get a head start on my yard sale! Three signs that were coated so they were very sturdy and lots and lots of pricing stickers with preprinted prices and some blank stickers too. Made pricing items super easy!
"Super cute. But mouse is cheap. Didn't last an hour.. also weight on top only holds kittens. It will last with a 13lb cat on it, but seems to wear out faster.. by far one of my cats favorite toys. I hear him on it ALL the time!🥰"
This item can be taken anywhere with you in a purse or a backpack after looking at the budget planner it really is useful and helpful A person can use the envelopes to be able to save money anyday any where
"Love these!! I’m trying to replace all of my polyester clothes with natural fabrics like cotton and linen due to the micro plastics in synthetic fabrics, but I struggle with comfort. These are soooo comfy and the waistband isn’t restrictive."
"Comparing this to the regular over the counter PowerBar gels, the consistency is more like a fine applesauce, which is fine.  From a healthier standpoint, it's better for you as it doesn't contain HFSyrup.  Just wish it wasn't expensive."
"I have owned this printer since 1999.  I am still using it.  It has never given me any trouble.  Of course it is slower than the new printers out there, but I mostly print in black and white draft mode, and that is fast enough for me."
I really like this leash and wanted to be able to use it. But the button only worked a few times then stuck . I really like the feel of it except I wish the opening for the hand was bigger. Overall a good leash . We sent ours back
Very hard but super fun to try to put together. We almost completed it at the beach but had a few pieces wrong so need to go back and fix. If you’re looking for a challenge this is a must.
"This dress didn't fit me very well. The plunge was a lot lower than I expected although it shows a deep plunge in the pic. Wasn't a huge fan of the material either. Overall, the product was as described just not a great fit for me."
This piece would have been lovely if packaged better. The feather was so bent and damaged there was no way to straighten it. I tried several ways so I could not even wear it. If this was not an issue it's a really pretty necklace.
The product was perfect for what I needed it for I was just disappointed that it only came with 1. I needed 2 and it definitely should have been in the description that it was only 1. If i had known i definitely wouldn't have purchased it
"The leggings look like they were going to be too small but they fit great. It's just been to hot right now in Texas to wear them, but they feel and fit great so I don't see it being a problem."
"My daughter got a bar of soap from someone that knows someone that makes it. I loved it and couldn't get anymore so I tried this and it is PERFECT, I love how it makes my skin feel Thank you for an awesome product.Eileen Donato"
"Small, compact addition to  my walking . Easy to use and it fits in my back pocket or can hang with the holster. I. An area with coyotes, I feel much more comfortable with this in my pocket.. Will also be useful for dogs."
I love this heating pad. It heats up fast and is very comfortable.  The only downside is if the cord unplugs from the pad and when that happens the main plug has to be unplugged and plugged back in.
Beautiful dress!! I received so many compliments and the fit was perfect. I was hesitant about the material until I put it on.  I was also pleased with how well it hugged the shoulders. I wasn't constantly pulling them down which was nice.
"There were turquoise cartridges pictured when I bought this but as stated in another review, these are the regular gray cartridges that fit Tonic Studios Super Trimmer. They fit fine, just pop them in. Note that it's two cutting blades, no scoring blade in this particular package."
The skirt I had purchased. It was cheap quality material. And also It's too bad because I was wanting to use that too. For the springtime If you did Rousseau my order and not give me my refund. I would like a small one.
This is really cute but is actually more like a plush doll rather than a key chain as it’s way to big to be a keychain . One thing I did not  like is her hair is brown instead of being  red. The face is adorable though .
"The collar these transmitters attach to really need improving. The collar is thin, scratchy nylon that seems to irritate my dog's neck. But the transmitter itself works great and I love the automatic door - just need a comfortable collar for large dogs, please!"
Love this back and all of the pockets!  They are all perfectly sized and placed. The strap is really long which is hard to find for a crossbody. Fabric is durable. The pattern is a little cheap looking though.
"Having early stage glaucoma, my eyes were slowly getting worse.  Since taking Premium Vision Support my eyes have remained stable with no changes.  I will continue using it, and highly recommend it!  As my ophthalmologist said, &#34;It's working, keep using it!&#34;"
"I am a first time Feeney buyer.  Very good pen for the price.  Writes surprisingly smoothly.  Pen arrives in a nice, sturdy box with a converter, extra cartridge, and instructions for fountain pen newbies. Follow-up email from Feeney after purchase indicates attention to detail."
"Super cute in pictures, and may have been very cute in person, if mine hadn't arrived broken. I considered trying to restring and repair it, but would be afraid it would fall apart while I was wearing it. Very disappointed"
The tiny needle on Faller Expert cement allows me to apply cement to exactly the locations to bond plastic model pieces.  The only difficulty is keeping that hollow needle from being clogged. For that I use an inexpensive wire-welder's tip cleaning tool.
I work at a dental office and I would not recommend this toothbrush. Since I can not return it I’ll just use it for travel and will go pay the money for the sonic care. Thick bristles and low pressure.
My 4 year old daughter absolutely loves this.  Plays with it everyday and definitely gets her imagination going.  It was a little difficult to put together thought.  Worth it though to see her face on Christmas morning.
"This pre-workout powder works great.  Energy is almost instantaneous. Most of the ingredients are great. However, the sugary content is almost to the max, sickening. Ditch the stevia and maybe the beet and it would be a great product."
Fits great and they're warm. I really like the removable suspenders. I got a cherry pink color. I thought it would have more a reddish pink but it's just a warm pink color. They're easy to wash and came clean.
"So I purchased one locally to try out with my very pulley dogs. We have used gentle leaders (they never learned to walk without it) so instead of buying a new gentle leader, this is a great all in one substitute. My dogs don’t mind them and walk great."
"I used these for the Life Cycles theme. I left them out in my preschool classroom and they loved it. The items held up to 3,4 and 5 year old using them everyday for a month. I will buy other life cycles models."
So this is a nice pullover if you don't want to always have a hoodie.  I'm tall and this just fits so no dryer for it b/c at 100% cotton it will shrink instantly.  It's medium weight and ok soft.
"This is a gift for my grandsons, who like using bamboo toothbrushes. I introduced them to this concept a couple of years ago to get away from plastic. I have never used this brand, though.  The delivery was right on time."
It was smaller than I thought so I ended up using it on top of the dining table with decor on top instead of under tree. Would be okay size for a 6’ tree or under. One edge kind of sewn funny.
"This planner has everything I'd ever need in it! It's not overwhelming with TOO many options like a lot of planners are these days. It has the essentials without being underwhelming too! The binding feels sturdy, pages are good quality, and the design is beautiful!"
"We have 2 small dogs that have short hair, it pick up most of it with ease. Plus it has a cover on it, so every time you set it down , it doesn't stick to the table or counter. We love it!"
"LEGO never stops to amazed me with the new designs and this set is a perfect gift for someone who loves race cars. Won't disappoint. As always easy to assemble and with all the necessary parts, there's never a missing part."
"So I didn't realize that the opening on these folders is on the short end and not the long end. This makes it even harder to get papers into the envelope because they always catch along the sides. Ugh. Otherwise they are great...well made, sturdy, etc."
"These bop blow up bags are so much fun. I filled the bottom with sand instead of water and it works wonderfully.  We are using one of them, giving grandparents one, and saving one for a spare. Great toy and so inexpensive."
"This Citrus Bergemot is instrumental in balancing blood glucose levels back to normal.  This is a wonderful product and was also recommended by my prevention doctor.  You can be certain it will help you keep your HbA1C in the Five Club, which is the healthiest place to be!!"
This sheet saved my sanity and sleep for my sweet four year old who is autistic.  He sleeps comfortable through the night now and loves to have an added weighted blanket for cooler nights while the sheet itself is great for the summer!
Really like this product. Use it frequently in between cleanings at dentist. Having dental hygienist to do thorough cleanings professionally is still a necessity. But I like to use it in between cleanings for my most visible teeth to keep them looking their best.  Easy and safe to use.
"As with others, the buttons didn't work.  I was hopeful, but alas I was foiled.  The light did work but no sound and I couldn't turn the frangrance on.  So, I returned it which was super easy."
The face cover portion is a good fit and would work except it’s nearly impossible to attach to the mask. The lanyards are durable and work well. The cute little head strap pieces are not stiff enough material and do not stay in place.
I am obsessed this is way too cute. I got a large for my 40 pound dog and it fits him well but I dont think it would fit a dog too much bigger. He looks so so cute and it is super soft!
When I received these the pattern colors were very dull and not as colorful as the picture online displayed. I was taken back by that and wish the writing on the bottom of sticker was more bigger and visible as is harder to read.
These are great little printers. We use them on our production line. We run a few hounded of labels a day. The only issue we have is the cutter blade goes dual and you can not replace them. You just have to get a new printer.
This is adorable and the perfect size for my 1 year old daughter to put her babies in! We debated getting her a typical baby doll bed but they were too tall for her to use. This one is just right.
"Calico Critters are sturdy, well made, very detailed, and pieces fit well in doll houses, or just at the table.  Our daughter's imagination opens up, as she makes up stories for each setting.  Great for an only child to self-entertain!"
"I wasn't expecting the extra two page spread in between the months.  This makes it a bit awkward to quickly navigate to the month you want, but it more than makes up for it in functionality, at least in my experience."
These are okay. They do not seem to wash well for me and my fish do not like them for some reason so I ended up taking them out of the tank. I do not believe I would buy these again.
"The bags are okay, however the pattern of the real bags do not reflect as in the picture. The pattern an colors are a little off. They are good for now, because of the size, however I will not order them again."
I used this on my cat when she had an injury on her ear. Its soft and cushiony so its not uncomfortable like the regular plastic ones. Very easy to clean. This cone is ideal for pets and I would highly recommend it!
Bought this for my daughter. She loves it. She’s breast feeding and this gives her some time to save some for traveling or night feeding. Suction power she said was awesome and easy for her to use. Very comfortable to wear. Price was worth it
The cage was easy to assemble. I am pleased with it. My love bird likes it. I gave 4 stars because the legs arrived with some rust or what looks like rust on them. It will not wipe off. I will just spray paint them.
"My sugar glider really seems to love hunting in each cup for food/treats/toys. She lost her sister about a year ago, so I'm trying to find things to keep her occupied while I'm sleeping.  It's very easy to load, hang, and clean. Highly recommend!"
"Extremely simple, quick, and fun. A mix of Uno (trick taking games)  and Jenga (stacking dexterity games). We get really competitive over this and often play more than 1 round. The cards are sturdy and have held up well. Would 100% recommend!"
"My snails came to me perfectly packaged as I live in Florida and it’s very hot here right now I was worried they wouldn’t make it but was surprised how well they packed them with and ice pack to keep them cool very pleased, thank you 😊"
"It fits perfectly! I am 5'3 and weigh 146 lbs, usually wear an 8-10 and bought the large. Not too tight, not too loose, perecer for work. NOTE, the pattern does not continue to the back so I took off one star for that."
"I tore my hamstring and wore this while rehabbing.  It was perfect, very adjustable, comfortable, and not bulky. I haven't worked out in it but i suppose you could. I would probably buy an elastic style to workout in."
From the photos with kids it looks like it’s quite a bit bigger than it is but it’s pretty tiny. The stars are incredibly difficult to peel off the main sheet. All in all super disappointing but at least they fixed the typo in socks for this set
"This bracelet elephant is so cute, small, very bright red, very well packaged ready for a present, it has some sentences regarding the lucky elephant, it could be a nice gift to anybody who need to be remember how the dreams come true just to believe in them."
"These are very cute but I have washed them all twice and they still have a strong chemical odor. It seemed to be the ducks were a bit oily as well. It almost was a smell of gasoline. I'll keep washing them, but I would not buy them again."
"Notice they super impose a full grown German Shepard, sitting fully upright, inside the door of this crate.A million choices in advertising and they chose to make it look like something it is not - don’t trust it at all."
"This is my favorite seller for High John the Conqueror roots. Each time I've ordered, I usually get a couple of smaller pieces, and 1-2 really large ones; and the large ones are the biggest pieces I've received from any seller before! I highly suggest this shop!"
"Fits my puppy great with plenty of room to grow. I purchased the medium for my 9 week old boxer and it fits when tightened fully. The best part is that as he grows, more of the cool pattern will be revealed."
What an amazing deal! These shades are nearly $300 on the Vuarnet site - and I am happy I pounced on them when I did. They are big and funky and come with a great case and silky Vuarnet wipe!
The puzzle itself is great. The only problem is the quality of the cards. My daughter and I got splinters working with the cards. They are poorly cut and not properly shaved on edges. Very upset I got a splinter.....
"One of the noodles held air, but the other two leaked (one severely, the other slowly).  I tried to exchange them but it kept saying ""Something went wrong"" and would only let me return them which is what I did."
I love these because they are extremely absorbing. They do not slid off during the night. The ones I tried with gel got so heavy the diaper slid off. They now have an even better tail hole and even poop stays inside.
"These feel great, and I wish they had fit a little looser because they felt great when I had them on, they were just a little too snug. They will do a great job when it's time to play out in the snow with the kids."
"This is a great hide for my leopard gecko. It’s smooth on the inside and offers him a great place to lay in or on. The decor looks good in his cage also. If you have a larger gecko it might be small, but it works perfectly for us."
"Thought it was great at first but after a few days of use, the wooden bottom brushes have already come unattached from the frame and now only brushes left are on the sides. It worked great but not built durable enough for work boots."
"Great idea, works well. However extremely stiff, so much so my wife cannot get a pair of socks in it. Tried even with the thinnest pair of socks I could find. Still to difficult to use without unnecessary amounts of strength."
"I have not used the ones I just bought, but have used these bags for several years. I really like them. I think especially for older folks they are nice because one can cook just a little w/o having to dirty up a lot of pots. :)"
These are so easy to fold and a great size. They fit the clay earrings that my daughter in love makes and are easy to seal and put the label on. They are very sturdy and hold up well in shipping through the different couriers.
other reviews said it leaks.  mine did too but i screwed cap just a bit more and no leaks!!!  really like this.  doesnt take up room in freezer.  is more moldable to body than freezer type.
"This is a cute cap but has a shallow dome.  It you have a decent size cranium and hair, it does not want to stay down.  Maybe if you had a smaller head it would stay in place and be a good deal for style and value."
"This aquarium does NOT come with the coral decorations as mentioned, the filter broke after two hours and the ""coral"" looking top and bottom and are cheap looking and do NOT look like the picture. I bought a new filter, decorations, and painted the base to look more natural."
"I was looking for something other than the silicone band the watch came with as the weather is getting warmer. I like the way this feels on my wrist and it's easy to put on, take off and place on the charger."
"They are dried and hard enough to help your rabbit keep their teeth ground down I think, plus she likes them and eats all three flavors. You can crack them in half easily to extend the amount you have to give to your pet."
"Great quality, nice width, very very cute fall design. So far no problems. After tighten the collar for the right length did not get loose. My dog is on the big side and it fits perfect and looks good. Very happy with the product."
Got this as a good deal and was excited to use. It just didn’t have very much power and would not pick up pet hair hardly at all. Also had trouble turning so it got stuck under the couch. Haven’t used it since.
My 11 year old grandson found this set frustrating and disappointing.  He likes to play with his lego vehicles and once the lights are on the vehicle they are mainly for display and he has to remove them to play with it.
I didn't like how it was set up. It doesn't go completely down in the water. Not sure why they made it that way. It doesn't brush the water off as good as it looks like it would. Wouldn't buy again.
I have carpal tunnel in my right hand and it was waking me up with sever pain in my hand and middle finger.After the third night of wearing this brace the pain is almost gone and I can sleep through the night
"I’ve only played this game solitaire with the online variant. The basic variant is super easy if you just game the AI, but the foundation of the game is solid and I think it will play well multiplayer as well. A good purchase."
Most model plane motors have a 2.9mm shaft. You want the collet hole to be larger but very close to that size. 3.0mm proved to be to tight and unusuable. The next collet size up 3.1mm is the best solution.
I'm going to use this on an upcoming trip to keep receipts and other travel documents in. Very cute design with lots of transparent zippered pockets and enough room to add or remove sheets with the easy ringed binder feature. Love it.
"I thought I was getting CARDBOARD level poster boards, not poster-paper. This is the same cheap poster board that you can get at Wal-Mart for 69 cents or so. It is certainly not worth the $15.00 price for 4 posters."
"Creo que son los peores globos que he comprado en toda mi vida!Prácticamente son imposibles de inflarCuando tratas de inflarlo se explotan.Creo que este ha sido el dinero más malgastado de toda mi vida, doy una estrella por que no puedo poner cero"
I got this for my mother after she fractured her hip and damaged her spine. She has a pinched nerve which constantly causes pain. This device really helps her and relieves the pain. She uses is every time her back pain is acting up. Highly Recommend.
Anyone who reads as much as I do can benefit from these. They are great for tabbing your favorite places in a book or a chapter/page that you need to go back to reference. Also great for memos etc. Very multi use.
"Unlike most sanitizers, this lotion keeps my hands very soft and clean. It isn't oily like some lotions can be.  I bought some for my office and now all my coworkers use as well. We will be using this all winter."
"Huge! Our 8 and 10 year old boys had a blast opening the vacuum sealed bag it was shipped it. They could not believe how big the panda got!!!! My 8 year old sleeps with / on it, and takes it outside for sun bathing."
"The cartridges were filled as I expected but they are not direct replacements for my brother, the configuration is a bit different. Vent holes leaked, blue cartridge leaked when removed to check. They are not working and I will just toss them out."
"I added a calendar and this notebook is now my go to thing. I keep track of everything with it including a food journal,  appointment calendar, questions for doctors and everything else. It's better for me than my Samsung note 20 ultra 5g."
"This is well made! I actually bought it to use as a rear-view mirror charm. It's big enough to see the details but small enough to not look like tacky costume jewelry. It's slightly transparent, which gives it a cool effect in the light. I highly recommend it!"
"I really liked this coat  The sizing was perfect for my dog, with the exception of the band that runs under the tummy.  It was too tight.  So, I had to return it.  Pity, because the next size up was too long for her."
[[VIDEOID:d7cf41df29d49982536559a9f67a55d1]] This is a lot of fun with the kids. A Bubble machine gun is the only way to describe it lol. Shoots out so many bubbles at once it's awesome. The kids love it they have a blast. This is definitely worth trying and I would recommend.
Very disappointed in these cheaply made aprons.  I thought I would be able to add names to them with my die cutting machine but they are made from a cheap plastic.  Donated them to a daycare center because I figured they would be able to use them.
My pup is obsessed with this! It’s how he eats all of his food now. I have to fill it up a few times per day but it keeps him from scarfing his food down and it holds his interest for 10-15 mins!
"I like these bags. They are durable and large enough to fit standard 8.5 x 11&#34; paper. For someone that carries around a lot of loose sheets, notes, etc., having a couple of these bags in my brief bag are worth it to keep me from losing anything."
"I've been waiting a while to leave a review to see how these worked out. I have a 12 and 10 year old and they love these laces. They work wonderfully and have lasted so far. Easy to put together, the seller sends instructions through email. Very pleased."
If i could give this less than one star i would. It fell apart when i tried to use it. The pieces to replace the polishers do not clip back on. It's very cheap plastic and i would like a refund
Not as sticky as others but nice for taking notes. Works for me i needed for daily woek notes. I work on line and needed these for keeping notes on my extentions and different log in notes so I didn't need them to be sticky for a long time.
"This keychain is absolutely adorable. My boyfriend loves it a lot! It is very soft to the touch and cuddly, it makes me want to buy the bigger version of this beautiful Snuffles bear :o) The keychain feels durable and everything came in good quality!"
"I purchased it! I thought it was a fisher price toy! It's not, but that was my fault not the sellers.  It's really small so probably wouldn't have purchased it if I knew how small it was - it may be good for small hands though."
"Cheap.  The cost is fine, but paying $5+ for shipping is ridiculous.  The comment that 50 are only 4 inches high, I assumed there were 50 disposable pillows.  My fault I'll research more.  Thoroughly I. The future."
"Didn't take long to receive and they served their purpose my dad had neck surgery and we joked about him being Frankenstein's monster with his scar so I bought him these to add to his new look, he loved it."
"I liked the product as a stocking stuffer for my toddler, but there was a price sticker on it from Big Lots for about $8 less than I paid. So do yourself a favor and just find them at a store."
These are a relatively mess-free paint. The paint colors are rich and flow well from the containers through the brush. Great for 4 year old. An older child might get frustrated if trying to paint fine details since the brush isn't tiny. We love it though!
"My dogs LOVE these! They're durable yet soft and VERY Squeaky!  Washable by hand, mine take theirs out on the deck and run with the ball. I've ordered 2 sets and may need a 3rd! It's a big hit with everyone I've spoken to that have bought these."
These don’t hurt my ears!!! I am a light sleeper and insomniac. I must wear earplugs. My ears have hurt for years. These are the first earplugs that don’t hurt. They also block almost all of the noise. They are amazing.
They are great. I’m looking for a phone number to contact the seller because I ordered the 100 pcs just for the Blue koala twice and don’t receive it both times. It shows the blue koala in the pictures  However both times it was not in the bag.
"It's a great bag, my dog fits perfect inside and he likes watching from the sides.I'd really recommend this product it's very comfortable and the material is very good.Not only me but also my dog, friends, husband, etc like it."
I sized up because the reviews said they run small and well guess what? Those are even small! I’m usually a size 9 and I ordered the 10/11 size and they’re small. Very disappointing. The look and color were so cute too.
"The stuffing's a bit lumpy, and the faux fur covering collects all the burrs my cat brings home in her real fur, but it's her go-to place for a nap, which is what matters the most!  Medium is the perfect size for an adult cat."
The look and fell of the heater is great but the function of the heater is horrible does not heat or keep aquarium by far worst heaters I have ever purchased if you keep warm water fish I would not recommend
Love this purse so much! It glows in the dark like it said. I have noticed while using it the design on the inside on the corner is rubbing off a little (it's the side that rubs against my side.)
Flavor is good compared to similar products I’ve tried. After 2 weeks I can tell a difference in my joints. I’m a runner so my joints need extra TLC. Be sure to shake the bottle before drinking. Contents separate otherwise.
This is great for those with leaky gut. This is the only flavor that is barely tolerable. If it didn't help so much i would never drink it. I have prime so I save on shipping from buying it here.
"I’m very pleased with this 2-pack protectors. They’re the right size for the vaccination cards, has a ziploc on top and a hole so you could wear it around your neck if you choose (to present at an airport, for example)."
"Awesome pants, I love them. Fit perfectly, seem very well made. I tend to be very tough on pants with my job so it will be interesting to see how they hold up but I have high expectations, they seem to be as tough as nails,"
"I have no problem with the refills, in fact I love intuition razors.  But I was sent 4 packages that have a handle with a blade attached and 2 refills.  Now I have 4 large plastic handles and a lot of unnecessary packaging."
Love the look of this product. Gave 4 stars due to the thinness of the paper. It’s a floppy card stock. I guess if your handy/crafty you could add thick cardboard to keep it sturdy. I do love them but just thought it was a cardboard box type product.
The colors are beautiful on this item but the stones were not on correctly. I had to remove one stone and still cannot get it on correctly because of all of the glue. This is frustrating and may have to take it to a jeweler to get it fixed.
Our cat refuses to drink from the water side as it has holes that look black that scare him. Revision of the dish set up - just have the water run directly in to the water side from the dispensor bottle - like we had previously had.
"I bought two of these books.  One book is for map making on various rivers that I fish, to keep notes on fishing spots and whatnot.  The second book is for note taking and observations with my telescope.  Its a nice, well made book."
I bought these earrings for myself in April and one already broke in July.  It's a piece of junk!  You'd think It'd last longer considering it's supposedly genuine gold but nope.  Only lasted not even 3 months and it broke.
"My two children, 4 an 9 loved this toy.  It is not something they can do alone, heck, even I had to read the instructions several times to get it, but the end results are worth the concentration and energy."
"I’m self conscious, thick with a mom bod. I usually run for the highest waisted swim suit I can but I took a chance with this and my boyfriend loves it. It covers just enough and makes me feel confident."
"The chips have a smell about them.  They also feel greasy.  At first my dogs just left them laying,  finally came back and tried them later.  They chow down with other carrot chips I have given them."
"Terrible! It's not a cuff and it's not made to sit like the photo shows. It has one post placed on the bottom part, oddly on the thinnest part of the cat body. And when it came, the post was bent. Worst drunk purchase so far!"
"It's colorful and strong and sturdy and I love it, but my bird is terrified of it.  Nothing personal, he just hates everything.  I think it would be a terrific addition to your cage if you have a normal bird."
It’s a beautiful necklace but the chain snapped within two days of wearing it. I suggest if you have kids or your necklaces tend to snap on your shirt throughout the day then buy a thicker chain for the pendant. Other than that it’s very beautiful
"The color and pattern of the dress was very nice but it did not fit well.  It was way too big overall, too long, and the material feels cheap.  It is not flattering at all.  I returned it."
"Loooove the dress. It's the perfect length and the colors are beautiful.But the top fits big.I'm 5 ft 6 in and 175 lbs. Size 38d bust. I ordered a medium, but there top part is too loose. Will be exchanging for a small."
wasnt really able to wear it because i got it way too big for me??? i keep making the mistake of sizing things up on amazon lmao i could smell the dye in the shirt it smelled really sweet but the fabric of the shirt felt really cheap
Not the size listed.  Says product is 6&#34;x8&#34;.  Plane is more like half that size.  I needed this for a cake topper and if I can't rely on sellers info I have a serious problem!! Probably a great toy but not as advertised!
"I got this to do Bible study with and the boxes are so small it's pointless. I had to give up using it. I'll save it and redate it for another use someday. As a faith planner for the mini, it's just too small with the vertical layout."
"Sometimes they work, sometimes they dont.  For the price, worth the gamble. The ink dried fast enouh and lasted (especially if the printer is set o eco omy).  I don't recommend photo print g thouh, but it did alright when  I printed christmas cards"
"I received Lysol wipes but only one package of 80, not 4 packages of 80. I can not verify that it is actually Lysol...it smells citrusy but the packaging seems fake/blurry and you have to cut into the packet to open it which is not typical."
Doesn’t work. My teeth didn’t whiten and all’s it did was smear all over my mouth and lips with nothing to seal this whitener to my teeth like strips or teeth covering. Also takes an eternity for the gel to come up when you twist it.
"Most excellent book.  Bought for my daughter who sings Gregorian chant in choir.  This is the second purchase for my second daughter who does the same.  Great binding, which is important because it is a very big book."
I’ve used Fresh Step Litter for years. It works to hide smells quickly and has a fresh scent of its own. I’ve had six cats at one time tho their aging has me down to one now. I always feel confident that my house smells good.
Got this set for our 18 month old granddaughter and noticed that it has some small pieces that can come off. Luckily I removed those pieces before she found them and chewed on it. Maybe suitable for older children. She loved the set though and played with them often.
I wanted to try this because I was tired of needing to bind pages temporarily and hated having to pull staples.  This was a great solution.  It securely holds even a few pages and can be removed and reused.
"The color is perfect, especially against my dog's auburn fur. My family was worried it might be &#34;too girly&#34; for our male dog but It is not. I have not washed the color in the washing machine just yet but it looks like it will hold up well."
"If you wash this in a machine, do not place it in the dryer.  The black rubber on the bottom will disintigrate and the mat will ball up and be completely useless.  If you use this mat, wash it gently, no bleach, and dry hang to dry."
"The color is sturdy and comfortable. My dog is 27 pounds, and the medium size fits perfectly. The clips are sturdy and easy to take on and off. I like the reflective strips and reflective stitching around the entire collar."
"Good seller and well timed shipping, but this hat leaves a lot to be desired. It seems very cheaply made. I would not recommend buying this product seems like it's probably made in China. I wouldn't even purchase if I had found it at a gas station."
"it's a cute note pad  mine did come a bit bend, little bumber , once paper is bend ,no way to fix it ,but i will enjoy it ,was going to be a gift ..will not use it as one with the damage ... needs better packaging"
"Not sure if they are fully KF94 compliant, as there is no ROK seal of any sort on the packaging. Mask offers a good seal. Snug to the face without being too tight. Lacks a clip for relief on the ears. Suits the purpose otherwise…"
I am an ESL teacher and I use this game as a fun way for students to use descriptive language.  I waited a long time for it to be in stock at a decent price. It is a great game and I wish it was more readily available.
Works well for quick battery tests.  I have used it every time I go to fly.  A must when using a parallel board for charging.  Nice and small for the field box or if you want to keep it on board (if you have the room).
"I am impressed by the ring. Well made. I ordered a second similar product (three crosses) and the company twice sent the wrong ring! Very disappointed (I quit trying), but this one is packaged correctly and fits well. Delivered quickly by UPS, I am glad for this one."
"[[VIDEOID:4535e353cd473324e5cec7484ee7ebe5]] I sent this creepy dude to my sister...anonymously.After she was done freaking out and realized it was from me, she started having fun with it.She's had a wonderful time hiding it places to  scare her boyfriend. It truly is a gift that keeps on giving."
I am racing on a very clean parking lot yet it still get debris in the unprotect gears. Tamiya car has plastic gear cover and this one does not. Axels were defective upon delivery and were bent and binding. Had to replace them all four.
"Love this calander, I always do a calander for the next year for my dad, with holidays,birthdays, I love you's, and important dates for him and give on Christmas,He loves scenery's in this beautiful calander,tyvmNeed one for 2023 now,tyvmShow me your 2023 ones when they are available, please,tyty"
"This watch is amazing! It’s so beautiful~ I never wear watches before because either they are not beautiful or convenient. But this watch! You can’t even feel that the watch is on you, it’s so light!!! My friends say this is a very good watch to buy!"
I was not impressed.  These can unassembled and the sticky tabs that were supposed to attached the wooden sticks to the tops did not work at all.  I ended up using more the decorations I bought at the Dollar Tree than these.
"The Quality is lovely. The price was great.  However, it was very small.  All of my tops are a 2X, I ordered a 3X and it fits more like a 1X. But the service and quality were great."
"I saved some dollars on the refurbed replacements but they've not worked well with my HP printer.  I was getting continuous error messages, notice of low ink despite being new and one of the new cartridges also leaked out of the package."
"Received all on time and they are a fine, quality product at a super price.  I had considered buying tool and materials to make my own but there is no way that I could have come out ahead on that idea.  I would highly recommend these."
"It's a bit on the expensive side, but worth the money in the long run. The quality is as advertised.I use the hook to hang on the tank while the other end is connected to a pump, which pumps the water over the edge. A bit crude, but it works."
I've done various brand name products and been disappointed with the results.  only people rating them badly probably work for the brand. I bought a large OEM supply from Sam's for around $25 and I don't want to use them after receiving these. I will be buying these again.
"He likes to attack things outside the tunnel, so his claws and teeth are constantly punching through. I can already see a bunch of holes lol so I'm prepared for this to be shredded in maybe a month. Still, it makes him happy!"
"Always looking for new cars or new versions of existing disney Pixar cars for my grandson who collects them. Found these online, have never seen these at my local  department stores (target, Walmart, meijer ). He will be so excited."
"The quality is good but the sizing is huge. My calf is 15.5 inches so I ordered a medium, it was way to big. The very helpful customer service sent me a small pair instead and even it was to big."
"The print on these is adorable, but the quality just isn’t there compared to other mocs. I have no idea what PU leather is, but it’s not leather. These aren’t soft and moldable like I expected and have found in other brands."
"The pet sweater is adorable on my pup.  She wears it and loves the nice warmth it gives her.  The companies suggestions on size are ‘spot on’.  I definitely will buy from this company again.....Also FAST shipping,"
"The sharpener is awesome, the holder broke pretty quickly so he went back to the tucking the pencil behind the ear. He really likes the sharpener and it makes the pencils last longer. Unfortunately he can't find the sharpener right now but is sure it will turn up."
"This dress is the CUTEST thing ever! It runs true to size (we ordered an xs). The only thing is that the dress came with a snag in the seam on the bottom, other than that it really is a must have for both cats and dogs."
"My banner was delivered as stated.  I was surprised by the thickness and clarity of it. Just be careful when downloading your picture... making sure the photo is straight and clear of, because print will show everything on the banner."
"Very cute, but the teapot doesn't pour very well compared to the other one my granddaughters have. The liquid just trickles out then when the teapot is lifted to an upright position, the liquid drips down the spout and makes a mess."
"These headband leis are absolutely gorgeous, perfect for the girls to wear. Came in bright and beautiful colors that could make anyone outfit, they fit any size head including kids. And yes they will shed just like any leis will do."
"When I take pictures sometimes I love to put print them and it comes out crystal clear, the picture be so big it takes up the whole paper. It makes it seem like real people are traped inside paper. Too bad color printers come seperate with computers."
"Delivery was awesome fast, exactly what I needed to replace the one that bent and then broke in my Gerber tactical ink pen.  For those asking if it fits a cross pen, I would suspect yes as mine came with an additional piece to top the ink tube."
"Wanted a simple sign, easy to read- right to the point and this is just that for our rental. The only thing that would make it perfect if they had small holes in the corners for easier hanging- but you can make it work."
They are very soft and cute but sadly I got a defective diana she doesn't have a collar or bell. it's not the sellers fault and I could return them but I don't feel like the hassal so I'm going to make her a collar and bell.
This set is very educational. It can teach a lot to kids. It comes with many shapes. There are many ways the children can use it. It kept them busy for a long time. I was happy with the quality. I would recommend it.
"Pretty dress, lovely fabric, nice fit - if you're 5'9&#34; or shorter.  I'm 6' tall and the waistline is about 6&#34; too high, and not high enough to be an empire waistline.  Will still wear it around the house though.  Very comfortable."
"I have this one, and the smaller made by Safari, this one has much better detail in the face, and more realistic looking.It's a nice weight, and scale so no parts to swallow if a kid also.For collecting, or show in a class this is the ones to get."
"This is a very well made product. I purchased 2. Both sets came with a bow, bandana, and collar. The ex-small fits my 8 week old Sheltie. I put it on her loose because of her age. It is so cute."
"This is bigger than I envisioned, but it was perfect for our little guys birthday party! It did look a little worn on the creases, but not awful. Would have liked some buzz light year prop pieces but other than that had lots of choices."
I just got these today for my two ducks... they have them on and they stay okay.  But I notice that they are still able to poop and have it miss the diaper.  Not sure what or why that is happening
"This dress is cute. When it was delivered my little daughter was very excited. Too bad it is cold outside, she was upset that she couldn’t wear it to school. The dress fits perfect, as expected. The material is also good quality. Very colorful, cute, and adorable."
"These notebooks are wonderful quality and well made, I especially love the page saver ribbon, pen holder and specific place to write the date on each page.I would recommend.Thank you for reading my review I hope that it was helpful to you."
We put this in my son's yogurt so that he gets his vitamin C he doesn't even notice a difference. He had scurvy from his vitamin deficiency and we noticed a major difference as soon as he started taking it.
"I was not sure it would work in my printer as it did not correspond exactly with numbers, but it looked the same and works perfect.  I will keep record of purchase to insure getting right one in future. Wish it would be 5000 copies not 3000."
Cloe is very beutiful and her name is spelled Cloe not Chloe so I hope I helped some of you. She is pretty not ugly...Beutiful eyes...nice outfit...awesome doll...I just don't have her yet but since she's cheap I will get her soon.
"This is a great dress,true to color shown on Amazon. A real sapphire blue. Material is lightweight but soft,will be a snap to wash and iron. I love the 3/4 sleeves and it comes mid calf for me (I'm short). Wish it was in more colors. Fast delivery, well packed."
Too stretchy and zero support. I gave it to my mother in law as we wear the same size and she loved it. If you like structure or support this is not your bra. If you hate underwire or any tightness this would work well for you.
"So far so good. Easy to install, same as original cartridges. No issues / rejection by the printer. Prints same quality as my previous original cartridges. Cannot comment on how long it lasts, as it is still in use with no problems. Will update review once cartridge is finished."
"Bought these for shoes that I am hoping to wear to Disney but they wouldn’t even stay in place for an hour at a fair. Slip and won’t stay in place.  Pretty expensive too-you can find similar ones for cheaper, though again, I wouldn’t recommend them."
"Great value and price for any Funko Pop collector. Just wished it would have come bubble-wrapped like a few of my other pops have came wrapped from other vendors. Box was not mint, which is important to collectors and actually had a small tear. Adorable Hello Kitty pop though!"
This was the best product I could have purchased. I use it in the mornings when my husband is getting dressed and had to use the over head light. No light gets in and your sleep is not disturbed. I would recommend the product too all.
"Wore my New Shamrock Earrings To Work And our for dinner today and got So Many Compliment’s! They are Really Beautiful And Very Comfortable. Beautiful color and very well made! Just the right size too! You will Love Them Too, I am Sure! They make me feel Very Lucky! 🍀"
I have been using pure lavender essential oils for years and I grow lavender this smells not even remotely like lavender. I would not have written this review if they gave me the opportunity to return. Gave me an instant headache. So pure and organic I really cannot not imagine!
The  item arrived fast. I have issues with the product not working. Its just too complicated and never works. No response from seller. I contacted the seller multiple times without response. Will return item. Amazon did great getting the repeller to me quickly and with a smile.
"I bought this expensive tug toy as it seems like good choice for a large .The fur start to shed even though my dog DID NOT play with it.He shows absolutely no interest at all, not even a sniff.Complete waste of money"
"there was no shipping information and my account says they are in route but they did arrive today, unexpected. they look great, very much like the images provided. great detail in the molds and paint is accurate. btw customer service on the seller's behalf was excellent"
"When I ordered this product, I thought it would be bigger. The necklace is about as big as the tip of a thumb. This necklace does not resemble the Heart of the Ocean very much, and the color is paler than the Heart of Ocean."
I use two of these pumps in my 100 gallon fish pond. The setup is easy and thankfully it is also very easy to take apart and clean. I only wish they would sell the carbon replacement filters so a whole new unit wouldn’t have to be purchased.
I upgraded our monkey bars with other items that I purchased at Amazon.  I mounted these to the ladder and the kids love them.  They are perfect in size and grip.  They also give our new monkey bars a professional look.
"I like this id holder because it is well made, however that is not leather. 1 star because i have not had it long enough to know about durability. 3 stars for sturdiness, 2 stars for value i think the price is a little steep ."
"I love this product, it protects your seats & kinda has a barrier that keeps dogs from jumping in front. Keep in mind if your dog is like mine, they'll still get past it...but it's a nice separator for most dogs."
I got this as a fun distraction for my dog.  She loves to chew but has become bored with her chew toys.  I can sprinkle a little bit of dry cat food in this and she's happy hunting for it for quite awhile!
I was so sad they were too small for me. My friend who is a size 4 fit her perfectly. So I gave it to her. I was really upset and extremely sad. Since when people who are size 4 Considered to be large people?!
"These insoles are made from EVA. They are not as durable and give less cushioning than insoles made from polyurethane. The insoles I received were much larger than my shoes, so I had to trim them down which is a hassle compared to insoles that are properly sized."
[[VIDEOID:afb3525172d2902d0c9db491c0a92e9f]] I love the set and flavors options especially coconut one of them I favorite it smelling a really strong without even opening and keeping in bathroom I can feel the smell really well good pricing and beautiful packaging which is possible to use as a gift packaging as well
"The shirt is comfortable and the message comes across clearly. People either shake their head when they read it, or stop me to ask about it. I even had one person tell me they were very offended by the shirt's message (perhaps they are a math hater, IDK? LOL)"
What did I like it? the Design and the Material the size small if perfect for me.  What I don't like it is the Material it is not good to use washing machine it is better to hand wash it!
"For what you pay, the quality and texture of the material is acceptable. The bottoms fit well, but the top was a bit small(still wearable though). I bought a size Large. I wear a size 10 pants, and I'm a 36D bra."
Did not receive everything that is pictured. Namely the blaze truck balloon displayed in the middle. Instead I received a generic monster truck that would not float when filled with helium. Star balloons also did not float when filled with helium.
smaller than I figured but just as affective at stopping a door from leaving a door knob whole in your fall. the white rubber hasn't left any scuffs and its springy enough to move when vacuuming but sturdy enough to no fall off the mount.
"Love this durable adorable dolls who do well with pool parties &amp; spa days! My 4-yr-old granddaughter puts them in their big, bubble bath with liberal B&amp;BW foaming soaps, then she thoroughly rinses their hair—and the dolls retain their resilience &amp; brilliance!"
"the other color out of stock so I bought the green one. The bright green is not bad at all. I used it this morning, it’s more quiet than the last one got for my pets. This price is better because I got it on sale."
Awkward fit. I’m a little on the curvy side but leggings continue to fall off me during the day and unable to wear them unless I have a shirt that fully covers my behind. Awkward in the crotch area as well. Wouldn’t purchase again.
"Not as tall as I'd like it to be. If you're looking for height, this probably isn't for you. I do like that it's a wedge, so it's a nice option for driving. It's a great fabric, so it really stays put in the office chair and drivers seat."
"Great for home, light-weight, not all that big. Prints fast, scans fast, copies are good too. THe only thing I hate about it is the lack of the USB cable!!! But mostly it's a great little thing for a small amount of money"
"There's really not a lot to say about it, I bought it as a gift for a friend, it shipped out same day as I ordered it and was at my house in just a couple days with out any problems. Thanks!"
Installed easily and works. Much less expensive than other sellers. No idea how long it will print. (Who ever recalls how many pages have printed on a cartridge?) I wonder what to do with the old cartridge; it seems too good to discard.
Love Love Love! I did a lot of research between magnetic and velcro and I'm glad I went with this set. Be careful with getting water on the cutting board. It's not a real cutting board. But we still LOVE this.
My wife has now ordered 3 different colors and loves them. Almost everything she orders is way too big. She is 4'10 105 lbs and the size 4 fits perfect! She normally wears size 0 or 2 for reference. Seems to be good quality and looks great!
"This suit runs really small. I wear a 1x and bought a 4x; could not get over my legs.  I will be returning this item for sure. I did love the print and how it's made, I wish it fit me."
"The design of the top of this is straight across, too wide to fit snuggly to my eye (my last curler had a higher center and narrowed to the edge like the natural shape of the eye) so I can not get it close enough to do any good."
It is not what it looks like in the picture. For one it's a keychain and two it's super smaller. So before thinking this is a full-on plushie. It's not Don't get me wrong I love it. But I did not expect this.
"I looked at a lot of different versions of these signs, this one was by far my favorite. I have been getting tips, so it might be my lovely personality, these signs, or a combo of both but I'm glad I bought them! I would recommend."
"This was incredibly small for a woman who wears an American size 12. Loose threads, a cardboard tag throw in the package and no labels for care or to indicate front and back. I'll give it to my tiny neice since it was only $14.99."
Protein pretzels are OK for a snack much better with a mustard dip.  have a little bit of an after taste.  Ok as a substitute for a snack.  I would give them around a 3 1/2 rating.
additional review: printer says there is only 30% toner remaining yet faded stripes are appearing even after performing the toner distribution remedy.PLUS it went up $10 since Marchoriginal review: low price but solid value. certainly will buy again. Print quality excellent
I bought these for my dad as recommended by his doctor.  They are very easy to manage and put on him. They have just the right amount of compression without being damaging to fragile skin. The material is also very soft.
"This is way to small my granddaughter wears size 10 and I got a Large, she can't even get it over her breasts and she is only 5months. It's a regular t shirt with no room for growing breasts or belly. Very disappointed, really wanted this for her."
It was tall enough and the base piece was a good size but it got smaller and smaller the higher it went. On top of that it got pretty wobbly. I had all the pieces screwed together pretty well too. There is no way a normal sized cat would fit.
Some glasses types it works some it doesn't. We primarily use this to keep eye glasses from fogging up when we are wearing masks. Not the most reliable and sometimes it makes my eyes burn so be sure to read the directions!
I lather my 19 year old mare’s back leg with vetrap (doesn’t have to be super tight) that had cellulitis and has chronic lymohangitis for 2.5 years. It works to reduce the swelling overnight! Less swelling takes a lot of pain away and she limps significantly and noticeably less.
I use this everyday and get so many compliments. The stickers and all the holidays it includes make it so complete. I've never been a planner person but this encourages me to use it everyday and brought so much order to my life
"I don't like the idea of needing a mask, but my new place has a lot of street light.  But, I sure like the way this mask cups around the eyes and doesn't mess up my eye makeup.  Very comfortable."
This set is amazing. I had one several years ago and this trick is of the same or better quality.  The detail is amazing and everything works very well together. There are several tricks that you can do with this trick and all of them are mesmerizing
"This stone is very pretty.  I only wish I haD done what I now suggest, then I wouldn't have been surprised by the small size.  But since it's a nice stone with a pretty finding I also wish they had more stones in brighter colors."
"I was so excited to receive Disney Princess replacement heads for my daughters, however that was not what came. Frozen 1 heads came. Now that is fine, they like that too, but they are more into Disney Princesses like the picture, than Frozen Disney princesses."
"This paper is great quality! It's thick enough that marker doesn't bleed through to the next page, which is not something I can say about other pads I have of this type of paper. I use it for playing D&D and it's great for making maps!"
"This pen needs no introduction, and certainly not MY seal of approval, because everyone that has one loves it. I got this one in a stub nib and I'm hooked. Now I want more and more Twsbi's in every color! Ahhhhh....Such a smooth writer. Oh Twsbi. sigh.."
I have many stickers. These are not as easy to remove.  The paper they come on is flimsy. The colors seem a little off somehow. There's something lacking with these. I am a bit disappointed. There are better stickers out there.
"I bought this figure 6 months ago at under $10 and I still feel at any price that it is lightweight cheap breakable plastic and garbage that belongs in the garbage heap of action figure misses. Probably one of the worst figures I’ve ever bought, out of thousands. Sorry, honest."
i have used this product for a couple of years. i stick it on the side of my fridge and it is the only way i can keep track of upcoming events and appointments.  very convenient and easy to use.
"I like the concept and am looking forward to referring my dog training customers to this. It will give my customers the opportunity to use their dogs prong collars with ease. Although, I’m upset they only sent 1 when I ordered and payed for 2."
"This desktop calendar is the perfect size for my desk.  It is not a giant calendar in size, but it's a perfect fit for my desk.  I think it is made pretty well and I would recommend the product."
"I picked up a sample bottle. No it does not smell like anything at all.  Very mild. But it's not an affordable brand. Like other green products, the  big bottles are for people with ton of money.  Us mere mortals have to wait our turn."
The balloons were amazing and better than I could buy in any store.  When I was getting them filled several people commented on the latex balloons—they looked amazing when filled!! Will definitely purchase again!! You will not be disappointed.
After many lash perms and damaged eyelashes I knew I needed something different and this is exactly what I needed. I can charge and take it on the go. You can adjust temperature how ever you like and it tells you when it’s time to charge. I absolutely love this!
This has stood the test of time. I am reviewing a year and  half later and this is just as good as day 1! It looks very serene in our 10 gallon fish tank and gives an overall sense of zen. Great quality and really nice looking .
Nice fit but advertising it as genuine leather is a bit misleading. It’s leather but a microscopically thin leather glued to a thick plastic so technically it’s leather but not what you think. Knowing that the price should be less
"When the product arrived, the cover was moldy on the inside.  Additionally, the foam was ripped. There were no installation instructions included.  If you purchase this item, be sure to take it apart and look for mold.  Very disappointed.  Returning immediately."
I wasn't  sure how  to to  trim  my cats nails  so 8 watched  a video..  these scissors  were easy  to use. Ill update  if I have a problem  but good so far.
I brought this and ended up getting Covid and pneumonia . Hence I wasn’t going to work. Month later I take plastic off bracelet and it broke immediately by me taking the clear off. It was past my return window . Poor quality
These pens write well and they don’t bleed. The ink dries fast and does not smear or smudge like some other pens. I’m using them for journaling and writing in the margins of my Bible. I love the pastel colors of the actual pens. Highly recommend.
"It's an alright made leggings... However yes it's too sheer, kinda long, great high waist. I'm 5'9, 170 and its was long, fits loose around the ankles and calve areas. You bend over and you might as well smile cuar use its sheer."
the company i bought it from wanted me to answer like 500 questions and make me do a bunch of work for them to fix it. Screw that. Huge waste of time. Go to Walmart and pay a few extra bucks!
"I wanted to love this dress, but first of all, it was sewn crooked, which was very noticeable with the stripes 🙄. Another thing is that the dress is so long, you’d need to be six feet tall for it to not drag on the ground!  So disappointed"
"Love this product!! The shirt and tutu are soo soft. Unfortunately our tutu didn’t have the bloomers attached and it’s a little on the larger side, so we’ll just put her in some baby jeans! Very happy with this product and would have paid $25 for just the shirt itself!"
"This is our second Worthy Dog collar. Very sturdy, we just needed another color/pattern for winter.Very well made. There is a hard scratchy part of the stitching on inside, but I just give a light file with emery board. Will be buying more fun patterns."
This is just what I needed to document the contents of a personal estate. The stickers adhere well and remove with now lingering paper or residue (without scraping). Plus extra blank stickers for inevitable changes or errors in the sequence.
These bones are great.  Our dog loves them and they tend to last a decent amount of time.  She usually finishes them off in about 4-5 days.  The price for the quality is fantastic.  Great buy!
"I do love this dress, I do. And I bought it a bit large because I knew that this style would probably be too small for my chest area, but the top area still was too short and just looks a bit frumpy."
I got this as a gift to myself with the names and birthstones of my girls. I've been wearing it everyday fir the pass 3 weeks and I've been showering in it and the color is still intact. It was a good purchace.
"This is a great value and the needles were sharp! So much in fact I didnt feel a thing when I used them. I have been using them everyday for the last month and am very pleased. They fit my different pen types, and they never hurt."
"The bottle is hard to get intoWhen you finally get the patch it is thin, bunches up and you cant separate it on skin when bunched upI should have not wasted the moneyPinched sciatic  nerves are miserable but patches you cant maneuver alone make it worse"
"I'm 5''2, 36C and about 145 pounds.  A medium fits great.  Very pretty and very comfortable.  It is about 2 inches above my knees.  Fabric is light and has a slip under it so not totally see through. I bought 3 more colors after this one."
"White Mountain Puzzles are a pleasure.  The pieces are easy to handle and they fit well together.  It is quite enjoyable to sit at the table, listen to a book or engage in conversation.  White Mountain is our 1st choice of puzzle manufacturers."
Good idea that just slide in onto your head but they were a bit bulky for me. To hot too. I could wear it with my hat. maybe my head a little to bit. they were a bit tight around my forehead.
This novelty eyeglass stand was heavier and more sturdy than I thought it would be.  It was adorable and was perfect for a family member who is a huge Westie fan.  I was quite pleased with the purchase and would recommend to others.
"I can't live without my Filofax! This Fluro pink beauty is what planner dreams are made of. The color is shockingly neon, the craftsmanship is perfect and the leather is like butter! The Filofax Original is my favorite planner, and in Fluro pink, it can't be beat!"
Love this! I've been using this and M2 Tone to manage  the hirsuitism on my chin. This along with alot of fruits an veggies an avoiding process foods and complex carbohydrates has really helped to slow the hair growth.
"Wonderful card to give to an artist, and engineer, or just a lover of art. Well made and inventive. The enclosed stickers for most occasions work well, as there isn't much space inside the card for a long message. Will buy again."
I've used mine for 6 months now and not 1 problem just make sure your prob is on the heat tape correctly. I consider herpstat top of line when it comes to reptile thermostats. Sucks they dont have a redline 4.
"Update: 10/13/2015. The device is very effective no doubt. However, the material is poor quality. It smelled of rotten latex and yesterday it developed a leak. Lasted 3 months of regular use. I will have to get a new one of a better quality."
I got this because i love swuare necklines and loose shirts but it is fall off the shoulder big in the neck area.otherwise the product itself is a fabulous color in the tan however I would say size down if yall want this to fit like the model!
"Deadly is not exactly my cats character but he has taken out his share of voles, eating only the head and torso and leaving the arse end. This is very nice quality product with the elastic expander instead of those clunky plastic breakaway collars. Highly recommend."
Not the most durable. But who cares the best planner  I’ve had so far. So much space to write stuff. And so much space for notes and goals etc. it doesn’t feel like I’m cramming like all other journals.
This is adorable!  I did have to exchange for a size smaller.  But it fits my 8 lb shih Tzu perfectly and the material is Very soft and cuddly!  I got a size medium for my dog.
I was looking for a Central Park puzzle and this puzzle is absolutely captivating.  Fantastic quality and the seller shipped it so quickly.  I received it in a week even though my estimated delivery was 5 weeks after my purchase date.  Can't wait to finish it!
"After 10-15 minutes the display goes from a bright flashing red / white / blue to a dim red.  After some time off the bright display returns for a while till it fades again.Nice looking, well built but does not last long."
This pod easily snaps in-and-out of the cage for cleaning it's also chew proof which is great. It doubles as sleeping space and hiding space for them. 2 medium sized rats fit in there perfectly We definitely would recommend this for anybody who has small rodents.
"I love these packing accessories.  We have used them seperately and in the suitcases to organize them.  This set is perfect for my husband and I to share, and the bright color helps keep us from forgetting them on our trips."
I purchased this the week preceding my total knee replacement.  I was relieved that I did.  It's a great product and was very helpful.  I recommended this same product to a friends mom following her hip replacement.  She said that she was thankful!
"I love the style and color. It fits perfect and not too harsh on my head  being a migraine sufferer and light color eyes, so I ordered the blue and green and cannot wait for them to come in!!!"
I received this item in the mail. The packaging was open and there were only 9 instead of 12. They do glow in the dark but I'm disappointed since I need them 2 days from now and don't really have time to return and replace.
"Hi,  I bought this for my 6-year old daughter a few weeks ago at Toy's R Us for $14.99.  It was on clearance with extra off.  You should check there first!  Great price.  Great toy."
"It was bigger than I expected. I ended up giving it to one of my bosses and she loves it.I wanted something that isn't as bulky, but it was very nice. I would've used it if it fit better in my cargo pants I wear for work."
The product pictured is of the 7 pack 7 inch wrapped rolls. Those get 5 stars. What you get is a pack of the tiny ribs. False advertising and then you have to pay a dollar to get a return label. BS.
"It looks so great in the photo but it really doesn't fit well.  The waist is too large and doesn't dip in like the picture shows.  Plus, I like my shirts a little longer and this was is too short for my tall frame."
These bottles don't drip.  I use the larger ones to hang on the hamster cage and the smaller ones when the hamsters are being transported or when they are in a smaller cage while their larger cage is being cleaned.
It costed me more money to have to reprint the poor color photos.  Some came empty too.  I switched back to the brand new ink cartridges.  Ink cartridges are way too much.  Go to local franchise stores with kodak printers.  It's quicker and cheaper.
I would have paid more for a less cheap clipping ability. Purchased them cause everyone's always losing clippers. Figured this way I could put a pair on everyone's key chains. Will work in a pinch. But you'll need a nail file to smooth your nail edges.
Omg I love this harness especially with the unicorns and it looks so good on my mini schnauzer a perfect fit. I also love that it comes with a leash and the cord on the harness is long so she can’t really bit it like she wants to
"The poop will not come out by pumping the handle. It was a gift, we have only played it once. You have to pick the poop out of the hole. If it worked properly it would be a fun game"
"I bought this for my young cats, who tend to tear apart the old quilts and bedspreads we've used for cat beds over the years. I stuffed those items into this zippered cover and voila! no more stuffing all over the place."
"Well what can I say... it is a battery operated pencil sharpener.  And it does just that.  You put in batteries and you are able to sharpen pencils.  Since that was all I intended to use it for, then I consider it a success!"
"My dog Captain has needed a new collar for almost a year, what better collar than captain america! I love this collar, it's thick and durable (like a seatbelt). He is so handsome and loves how much attention he's getting with the new collar! :)"
Put a couple of these in a Christmas survival kit.  I liked the fact that it only has a few in it.  When I get the bigger one the get messed up in purse before I can use them.
"Loving this thing!!!!! So far it has help up after 20x uses. You can pinpoint different areas and basically sit there in limp mode while the massager does its job. Hurts sooooo good.If anything about this review changes, i alway update my reviews if anything negative happens."
"This preworkout gets me into gear to break plateaus and fuel my workouts.  The pump and amount of endurance I have when taking it is incredible.  Even when I feel tired, I still feel like I can push a bit harder.  I highly recommend this product."
"My daughter absolutely loves this apron or whatever you call it . I use it for painting , for eating popsicles anything you name this is great. Super easy to clean or just simply rinse off and let air dry it doesn’t take long ."
"We really enjoyed this puzzle! The glow in the dark looks really cool! I attempted to take pictures, but it looks so much better in person.We really like Ravensburger puzzles because of the thickness of the pieces and the softclick technology. This picture was particularly bright and fun though!"
"Excellent purchase, I had my doubts about whether the size of the pokemon cards compared to those of dragon ball super plus their sleeves to protect the cards were not going to fit in each pocket.BUT everything came in perfect, excellent purchase, very good condition, nothing imperfect."
The bows were smaller than the average small bow.  The Rosettes easily fall off when adjusting the bow to the dog's head.  The positive qualities was that it came in a nice assortment of colors and the rubber band is strong.
"This harness is sturdy, comfy and secure. When walking the dog it doesn't pull on his neck and it doesn't go under his legs when walking. Barney weighs 15 lbs and it fits him well. He loves it and so do we!"
This lapdesk is light and portable. I love having the mousitizer. I use it on the couch or in bed. I am also planning on traveling with it. I think it could be a couple of inches wider. My laptop barely fits on it.
It was exactly what it said it would be but it seemed to be repackaged. Nothing said Baby Alive so my child was not excited when she opened it. It was just brown cardboard packaging. Nothing wrong with it though. Just seemed repackaged
Nothing like feeling ripped off.  This bear was in memory of my brother who died too young and suddenly. At least they could have removed the sticker showing that they bought it for way cheaper from target then I bought it from them.
"I gave this as a little thank you to a co-worker who loves giraffes.  People take her pens often, at least she will spot this one if someone takes it. lol  It's actually a nice pen that writes great!  She loves it!"
I loved this Memorial.  For the price it is wonderful.  It is lightweight and if put on a grave would need to be pushed into soil.  I put it as a memorial on my wall with my dog's photos around it.
My African gray is 21 years old and he has loved this pasta mix for 21 years. He dives in head first because I give it to him warm. I make the whole package and freeze it in portions in muffin tins.
"Love it.Been looking for the office chair that is comfortable and also can change different positions for just relaxing.This is the one, perfect upright angle for working, extra thick foam for comfort and can lean back and put your feet up to relax. Very happy with the purchase."
"My cat does not object to wearing it, and we have stopped the steady flow of dead rabbits, etc that were appearing at our door as trophy's. Encourage anyone interested to look up ""prey safe collars ""and "" bird be safe collars""- which  explains so much better."
Two thumbs down. Unless you’re specifically planning to use it to massage the neck it’s useless. Much smaller than expected and when they actually get hot enough the handles are still too hot to hold while the rest of it is cool.
Was trying to do a puzzle with my family during this awful time and my puzzle happens to be missing 2 pieces. My stepdad has been working during this time and this is the only relaxing part of his day and this ruined it
I don't know if the price is high or low.  It's a cannister of a lot of translucent basic pencil sharpeners and they work well.  No frills.  If you just need a basic and don't care if shavings aren't collected it is perfectly fine.
"This was a gift for my nephew this is a great well made plush my nephew has loved this, even though he doesn't know what series this is from. Someday i will have to introduce him maybe once he gets a bit older."
"Love this shirt, recently got back into working and required business casual dress code.  Wears comfortably and is super cute for my active job as a PT.  I hate to iron, so I have to immediately hang it up or it will crease and look very wrinkled."
My daughter really enjoyed getting this as a holiday gift. It kept both kids entertained for several hours. I think I will have to find another paint to use in this kit for when the one it came with runs out.
"I am so glad that I bought these. They don’t change the look of my sneakers, but they make them so much easier to put on! I look forward to buying more Laceez to put on all my other shoes."
"Forget the others that say they have heavy paper that don't bleed through on here... Had to return those.This great dotted journaling book is the only one on here that actually did not.Heavy paper, and great size. Use those markers!  Use your paint!  Journal CREATIVELY😁!"
I use these on my goat and they are better 100 times better then the $400 ones I usted to use!!! The dont heat fast and the batter will last for days!!!! The clips on them aren’t great but they get the job done.
Is GREAT to quickly straighten my treated hair (I have hair botox- similar to keratin). I like it a lot even though it doesn't finish the ends as a flat iron does and I am sad that the beautiful purple color is paint and is starting to chip
This shaver is the worst in the world ever trust me don't buy it and waste your money and time it's gonna destroy your skin and when you return it they will take 3 weeks or more to refund your money so it's just bad idea to buy it
These little  chews have a scent that my dogs were very excited to try. They are soft and small so it's easy for your dogs to eat. These have been easy on my dogs stomachs they haven't gotten gas or upset stomachs
"After reading reviews this jersey runs small, I usually wear a large / or xl. I decided to go up a size for 2xl however was out of stock. Wound up with a 3xl which fits a bit loose.  A 2xl would have worked nicely."
"Just let the dogs in from the rain ...made quick work of drying their back and cleaning mud off paws. Seriously I don't mind the muddy spring weather now, these mits make it much easier. They are a bit big but the cuffs keep them in place."
"These are very sturdy, real wood envelope templates allowing you to make envelopes out of any type of paper.  They are also attractive and can be hung upon a wall.  Made to last!  I've since bought additional ones for gifts."
We bought this as a birthday present and the kid was so happy with the remote. It is so easy to drive it with the controller. It has so many lights and it is so nice to see it moving in the dark.
oh my goodness this is a great notebook. wish i had this when i was in school!! it’s laminated so u can write on the outside and the inside pages are so nice and sturdy. highly recommend!!! cant wait to try other things by this brand
"I love it over all got lot of complements, love how you can a just the chain but wish it was velvet or a silver chain. Love the blue hue on black & more white with a hint of blue on white clothing."
All the plus has is a remote timer. I thought the colors could be manipulated but I  was wrong. The actual LED array is only 6 inches long even though the dimensions show the arm is 9 inches long. Not worth $130.00.
This leash is a great length for on leash walks where you want to give your dog a little more freedom. I purchased them beach so they could wonder in the water a bit. Like anything at the beach they had to be cleaned well immediately to avoid rusting.
Ordered this costume to wear to volunteer at the Zoo and pass out candy. The costume fit perfectly and was so comfortable to wear. All the pieces to the costume were well made. I am so happy that I purchased this product because it was a winner in my opinion!
"So this is cute and perfect, however, it does not fit pencils. It is too short. Weird, right? Due to that small detail, I need to give this 1 star. It is a pencil zipper, and fidget case so we need it to hold pencils."
"Just don't like the squishy, plastic feeling they give me .  Just cotton socks feel better for me.  They felt really gross.  That is not something I saw in the reviews I read so I think it may be some strange sensation only i have."
Curled my hair three times with this thing.. each time holding the hair longer and longer into the barrel. 2 hours later my hair has fallen. My hair holds curls! Even tried with hairspray! Just doesn’t work. Sucks!! Waste of money.
So hard im afraid one of my pits will break a tooth! The head and tail seem like a plastic materiel maybe (hard and solid)? The middle is a bit different and i think hard rubber. Theres some weight to this toy for sure. Its very solid.
"Believe the other poor reviews.  Not poseable, as the sellers' pictures lead you to believe.  Tail ""sticker"" coming off.  Hard straw, as stated in another review.  Never gifted it to my granddaughter because it was so awful."
They arrived very crooked.  Right ear piece.  It's a shame because they are really sharp looking and like the shape of the lens which this shape is hard to find.  I did decided to order another pair to give them another chance.
We have an old Plotter that our techs use to print out schematics and prints.  The plotter is basically obsolete making it difficult to purchase ink or paper.  It is such a blessing to be able to find both on Amazon.
"I do not believe this bowl holds 2 cups- it is TINY. If you are purchasing this for a very small dog, or a cat, it will work find for you, but it is not as advertised.Also- the dish came in white, not blue. Very dissatisfied."
"I have used this product for years as a supplement to my diet and my active lifestyle.  Unfortunately, it is not vegan so I had to stop using it.  If your are not vegan I suggest you try Fruitein before other similar products."
"Ordered these with one day shipping but it took two days to arrive. One of them does have a small stain/smudge on the back which I tried scrubbing off to no avail. But other than that the product is great, both wristbands seem durable and are actually pretty cool."
I'd love this skirt if the elastic at the waist wasn't so tiny.  It is extremely tight and uncomfortable.  I keep thinking it will stretch a bit but not yet.  It is a medium and I usually wear small to medium.
Was super excited about this sheet. My horse was in his pasture where there are no sharp anything to rip or break it. The strap on the belly band ripped off.  I am very disappointed in this product.  Not even a day and it was broken.
"This fits the 2012 Kindle Fire 7 inch as advertised.  It is sturdy and well padded.  My only complaint is that it does not charge with the cover closed.  Otherwise, this is a great cover, sturdy, well padded and stitched and exactly as described."
"the pants arrived today.I ordered them for my son he is a personal trainer he has several pairs of the Tesla brand pants ,he swears by them for a base layer .They wear very well and are very well made."
"I had to put the big part with the 2 openings that my cat can sleep in, upside down as the holes were drilled wrong. Now their is no carpeting on the inside or on the top. I do not own a drill so i can not drill new holes."
I bought this to wear under skirt suit jackets. It's OK for that--it adds a little interest and splash of color. What I was not expecting was that it would be REALLY thin--almost sheer! You'll want to wear something under or over this.
"I take a puzzle on our family vacation each year, and this was the best I've ever purchased.  The quality you expect from Ravensburger and an image that lets everyone participate in a different section.  It made for a great group project for all ages."
"I'd had a wheel break apart on my cheap chair. I didn't want to buy another chair. I wish I could buy just one wheel, but I had to buy 5. These all went right on, they seem to roll and work without any fuss. Yay."
"Works fine and serves it's purpose of keeping our baby's heart meds safe from our preschooler, but pretty flimsy. The plastic is thin and the lock is a little hard to use. It opens fine but can be stubborn about re-locking."
"The earrings are just what I was looking for.  Just the right size for my second piercing.  Only one complaint, one of the earrings was missing the backing.  I had some spares so I just used one of them."
"Had a dog themed party for a 16 year old, had to be classy and not kiddie. Wrapped the silverware in the napkins and tied them with twine and the dog tags. Wrote guests names on the tags. Was too cute!"
"This works OK if you know how to use it. You can only put VERY little cleaning solution on the pad, otherwise it will streak... which was my initial problem and reason for buying this product in the first place."
We bought this as a gift for my daughter’s first birthday 4 months ago. She loves it and will rock on it for hours. It was not difficult to put together and I love that it’s not too noisy to have in our living room.
"My dog loves this house and she spends a lot of her time in there whenever she's not exercising or inside. The thing has been hit with heavy winds, ice storms, and other but yet it stands just like the day it was built. Awesome stuff."
"Perfection people! Everything is with patches, not that crap that they just slap on there, looks better than the picture shows. If you're a fan of the movies, you'll love this, they have #99 Banks and #96 Charlie's as well, I think I saw #33 Goldberg's as well."
My dog Ruby is 35 pounds for reference. The hat is very small. I thought it was adorable but Ruby hated it. She ultimately dug it out of the closet where I was storing it and shredded it before Halloween even arrived.
In looking for a comparable ink cartridge this one was the best value and had good reviews. I have had this product for a couple weeks and have been very satisfied with the printing and quality of prints. I would definitely purchase this ink cartridge again and recommend as well.
"At full charge, the battery lasts for about twenty minutes.  Also, it pulls on my hair - it's painful even using it on the smallest lock of hair.  I thought it would be good for touch-ups on bad hair days, but it doesn't make a difference."
This ring is so unique and I am so thankful it finally arrived.  It was definitely worth the wait.  Cannot wait to wear it.  Thank you so much for making sure I got it.  definitely a five star ring!!!
I love decorations like these because they are super cute and then super easy to store. Made a cute background for a valentines party. They are a felt-like material. Overall good quality and glad I didn’t have to put them together.
"Pretty, but too small.  There was not enough space to write appointments on monthly pages and the large center spiral ring is too big and obstructs the hand when trying to write.  Also, the tabbed pages were much too dark, making reading difficult."
"these girls will dance all day for you--on a dash board you are never alone and they never give bad directions, always a smile and a shake--you can't help but be in a good mood-even on the expressway--as gifts to others no one refuses them...."
I have nothing negative to say about this product.  I love that’s in powder and I take it in morning put it in my coffee and I don’t get hungry.  So will buy this again just love it!!!!
"Truly a beautiful piece of jewelry for your pet! The only issue I have is that I only put it on my cat for special occasions cause it is just too big and heavy for regular, every day use. Otherwise, beautiful and well made."
I'm a collector so I haven't taken Ashe out of the box.  She's very detailed.  Her costume and weapon looks exactly like the game.  It makes we want to play FFXII again.  I'm very happy with it.
"Perfect! happy with these durable mailers. I use them to ship items that do not fit in a letter size envelope and items that I do not want to bend. Size is perfect, quality is excellent and value for the money. Delivered next day. Will order again when needed."
Very cute book to go with the reindeer that is hard covered and good quality. Has a great story and nice illustrations. My daughter loved this gift! It was a better price on here than in all my local stores!
These were advertised as heavy duty stainless steel when in fact they are nickel plated pot metal!!  This is false advertising and these products should be pulled from amazon or the add needs to accurately portray the correct construction material!!!
This is a great activity for toddlers and it comes with allot of extra stuff like different tools and stencils. But it’s very small. And I’m not a fan of the way they designed some of the numbers and letters. It’s hard to tell what they are.
"These socks are better than expected. I have ordered a few different socks on amazon that say they are warm and ended up being thin and ruined after washing... not these!! They are thick, warm and have held up great after washing multiple times."
"The sound broke on this the first day. The front scanning light still works and is the best part. I wish this was a better toy, but for the price it's not bad. I also didn't notice the battery they hid in the package."
These Beef Liver treats are marketed for cats but they are at least an inch long which would be better suited for a 50 lb dog. I have to cut them up which is annoying. The company should cut them in tiny chunks to suit cats.
"When my personal economy improves to the point that I can afford to get new dentures, I'll replace the ones I have.  Until then, this product works great to keep me from feeling many pains from my loose fit ones."
I'm 5'0 and 104 lbs and the XS fits perfectly. You want this dress a little snug to really show off your curves. The white area is not see-through. I don't' wear a slip with it as I don't need to.
Overpriced for the quality and weas delivered so late from ordered confirmation.  I could have taken that extra delay in delivery tie to shop around more and find one like I already have at half the price from Home Goods.  The wheels stick and required full assembly.
"Absolutely beautiful..I have had it for almost a year and it has never tarnished..unlike sterling silver!! Everyone I know and meet compliments me on how pretty and beautiful it is.Update after 3 yrs this ring still has the same luster, and just as beautiful as the day I received it!!"
Perfect for your mask ! It could be a little bit longer but for the rest is very useful!!! My husband was not sure about using it but now he loves it more than I do ! I recommend it!!!
"These are cute little shirts. I needed the lightish yellow shirt to match daughter's daisy tutu, and this was the only one I could find to match.  The other shirt that came with it has probably been worn more though."
Everything was included to decorate for an 18th birthday party.  It was all super easy and very quick to put together.  Everyone was impressed with the decorations.  This is my second time ordering this 18th birthday decorations.
Perfect size door for our doxie. Like the sound me door for added insulation from the outside elements. Easily put in our wall. Doors are a little stiff at first and made it hard for our doxie to push it. But works great. Perfect size for smaller dogs
"The first 2 glow plugs didn't glow at all, and the next 2 lit up for about 10 seconds before they burned out! I never got them in my motor before they went bad.These GLOW PLUGS are nothing but JUNK!"
Great product.  Just used it for the first time.  Even used it on a leather chair which had a little cracking - made that look way better.  Used on some boots which had seen better days and made them look good to go.
"My dog is an aggressive chewer. Most things last 5-10 min. I used to buy only 1 brand that he didn’t destroy and I’m happy to say this bone has actually been better and he prefers it. I now have the Dino, Alligator and Zombie and he loves them all."
The pens are okay.  They do not all work well when you initially start writing.  There must be some sort of protective seal on the tip.  After a few times/minutes the ink is darker and more fluid.
"I have no idea why I did not buy this before , super easy to install , comes with his cable to connect to 110 v and works , feel so much better after installing this product , specially with Covid 19"
"I'm guessing labradors instinctively like duck because they're hunting dogs? My labrador loves these treats. They have a good crunch, and she prefers them over other biscuits made from pork or beef. These treats are also reasonably priced and have a short and simple ingredient list. Recommended!"
I like the jacket.  I read the reviews and ordered a Medium as per comments.  I could hardly get it on.  I am trying to find the receipt so I can return it.  Unfortunately you do not have the size i need in this color
"This calendar is cute. Stylistically I am more of a Ban.Do agenda girl, but for work it fits the desk calendar bill fairly well. I like the side plans for the month option, especially to keep track of work projects."
"This lighted message board is cute, and a good size. Material seems sturdy. However it arrived with a set of dry erase pens that are all completely dried up. We'll have to buy a set to make it work as a message board."
These are so pigmented and nice to work with. My only issue is they leave so many little brush hairs and clumps. For the price I would expect them to not do that but besides that they’re really good quality.
"I returned this product.  The top and bottom straps are the same size.  The circumference of most people's legs above and below the knee is quite different.  As a cyclist, mine certainly is.  I could not get the top strap to fit.  I returned immediately."
I have ordered this product several times with such wonderful results.  I use this bark for repotting my orchids.  It is clean and the size that offers aerated growing habitat for my orchids.  I will continue to use this product.
Just like the original Othello game I grew up with in the 80's! Even my 13 year old Instagram obsessed son will put his phone down so fast if anyone wants to play. Now he's figured out how to beat me on it. Great game!
My 3 year  old granddaughter loves the comfort and fit. Cotton is so comfortable. Wears well unlike gown made of polyester. She wants to wear a gown to bed every night. I went back and order one of each color.
"I just wanted something to carry a few pills in everyday and this worked beautifully.  It doesn't hold many, but was just enough for what I needed! I've had others that the latch popped open and this one hasn't done that once.  Would totally recommend!"
We love this book ! This is so relaxing and it’s perfect for kids or adults . I love that it’s not to crammed together and not to complicated but not simple either . This book is just right ! Great for gift giving to ! We love it !
"I love him so much. He is like little friend for tub.He sell me soap..But really, the paint job is good imo.hes super cute and silly and my friends had a blast laughing when I shared him with them.Good traditional rubber duck size."
A little disappointed that he is super slim. It exposed all the creases in my belly. I would recommend choosing one size up from your usual size. Thin lightning. The color matches the photos of the seller. I will most likely wear this unbuttoned. It looks cute.
This AirTag holder is exactly what I was looking for. Perfect fit for my dogs collar. Now I feel better knowing I can track my dog if he were to get loose. Quality seems great so far. Would purchase this product again.
"I received a round acrylic sphere.  It was exactly what was described.  I'm not sure who MANUFACTURED it, but the MANUFACTURER did a great job, and the SELLER managed to box it and give it to the USPS adequately enough for it to arrive undamaged."
"These brush heads actually fit my old Braun toothbrush handle as opposed to some other second market heads I have bought on Amazon.They are a little stiff, but work well for a good sonic toothbrush that Braun inexplicably abandoned for the new mechanical type."
"I would give it 5 stars but it was actually too thick to use as a mouse pad, which was my intention. I had to split in half. Also a bit too small (Width and length)  for a good mouse pad."
It was exactly what I wanted. I love that it isn’t as big as a normal desk calendar and that it stands up. It will be perfect for keeping up with everything I have going on this summer. Thank you!
"Surprisingly I had low expectations for this item, but the quality for the material was decent and it still held up after a cycle in the washer and dryer! The fitment is similar to what you would find at Forever 21 or H&M."
"My teammate and I were looking for a double sided magnetic whiteboard on wheels for our Physical Education classes and this was perfect!  It was easy to assemble, the included markers/eraser/magnets were a great addition and a great size for what we needed.  We would recommend this whiteboard!"
"These are the best pads I have used.  Nice clean tear off at the top of the page, pre hole punched for a binder and no spiral binding to snag your clothes when you carry it!  Paper weight is hefty without being bulky."
Love thise collar!. Love the fact that's its a belt loop style latch and not the clip. My dog pulls to much for clip ones. And this is holding up beautifully! And it's cuuuute! So hard to find cute patterned collars with this type of clasp....
Trash! Pure trash! I could have bought the iron patch and out it on better my self. The sweat pants are cheap as hell for the price. Logo faded and sweat pant material balled up like cheap dollar store clothing.
The mattress pad is unbelievably soft and comfy for my granddaughter.  The only flaw I can find is that it does get matted down so every couple of days we remove the sheet cover and fluff up the wool.
I made a lot of modifications. This was for a charity auction and they wanted some specifics. Changed a lot of plants and color scheme. And I really thought it needed an additional light on the right in the garden. Looked off balance without it.
Litter mat did collected hardly ANY litter at all. Disappointing since I waited quite a while to receive it. It is very expensive for a thin piece of foam you can fold up. Not worth it. There are a lot better choices at better prices.
"So cute , well made pleasant surprise for what it costs. Tools multiple purposes it's a mouse pad and and a tool to put a smile on someone's face when they having a bad day in my virtual Learning Classroom😁"
"[[VIDEOID:4e7303fe28c5d53943dc45a4044e17a]] Me vendieron primero una cama beige supuestamente para el tamaño de mi perro, sin embargo no fue así.  Como pueden ver es enana.  Luego compre la segunda que es gris y esa si le acomoda a mi perrita quien es feliz en ella y mas en invierno"
This was a great deal and the pills are working for me. Arjuna helps me keep my blood pressure low without taking drugs that give me all their side effects.  I take the pills morning and evening to ensure they do their job.  I'm happy with this product.
"I have two GSD and one mixed breed medium size dog . She wasn’t too crazy about it , probably due to her size and age but two GSD loved it and treats disappeared in a few days ;-)Would definitely buy it again."
"I didn't buy this for business cards_I'm a old school wet shaver (Shaving Soap/Bowl/Badger Brush/ DE Razor) ....And so I try many different blades, thus I have many small packs of various brand blades that I display on this New Caddy_ It's what my shaving Zone was missing !"
"[[VIDEOID:4ef8c8cf0218818b15fea1b4376cf6be]] I was very pleased with the quality of this toy/plush. It seems to be of good quality and decently sized. It's also has bright lights and cute galloping/bells/giggle sounds as well as a nice tag and an adorable little ""official adoption paper""."
"Pretty bracelet. Love all the colors. Would give it a higher rating if it were not so difficult to put on one-handed. The lobster claw catch is a little tight, and it takes multiple tries to attach it making it a bit frustrating."
"So fun - full and fluffy - perfect for our fur baby to get all the pets and attention she so loves - this color is perfect for St Patrick's day, pickle festivals or anything where green is the color of the day"
"This was a Birthday present for a 4 year old grandson.  He loved it! He asked his mom if he could take his gun to school. She said no. So he quickly transformed it into a dinosaur and said ""how about a dinosaur """
Awesome leash! No more pulling! I'm in total control now! I have larger dogs who love to pull and we have tried everything possible. The weiss walkie has turned a stressful task into a breeze! We BOTH love going for our daily walks now!
Works as intended. Although I do wish it had a slider so that you can see what the measurement is when you remove the caliper. You can still get a peek while you're measuring but a slider would have been nice.
"we really enjoyed this stone creative kit , I recently got my 7 year old Scribble Stones book so this is perfect for making our own! A great night creating our own Scribble Stones! Great product and shipped SO fast !"
The magnets that come with this won't even hold it to the fridge when it's empty!  It just keep sliding down - how pathetic is that?  I had to add my own magnets to it to keep it place.
This product just smears up my glasses.  I tried it on two different pairs of glasses and it smeared them up so bad I could not see out of them well.  I followed directions exactly as it said. Waste of my money.
"I bought these for my husband and I. I am still currently using mine and love it! My husband broke his within two weeks because he likely used to much pressure so that would be my only warning! Otherwise, I love mine!"
These where 100% tamper with add carts upside down and backwards in some of the packs whit no halo pulls in 15 packs DO NOT BUY IT IS Tampered with. I buy Multiple Yu-Gi-Oh sets from different sellers on Amazon and this was outrageous when I open these packs
For young kids- sick season is tough especially when you can’t give real cough meds- but this stuff has been such a life saver especially at night helping the little ones get some rest to try to fight any germs!
"I have gotten 2 printhead from this company, the first one was defective got 5 orange blinking lights which mean printhead is dead. The second one that was replaced by amazon only prints black ink no color. buyer beware of this company."
"NoteSpeed is an absolutely brilliant way to get students reading music fluently, fast! I use it with all my piano students, and they all love it. I have seen huge growth in site reading and music comprehension since I've been using it to teach in my studio."
"This is a four pack so I guess good value for the money. I wore the scissors and it is very light weight but if you wear this all night, glue the items onto the headband first. The scissors kept falling off"
If I could give 0 stars I would!!! I made a sublimation shirt and the color was dull so I left on heat press longer and still no improvement!!! One wash later the color completely faded off my shirt!!!! Super disappointed never buying again
"It is Wonderful!!  I just use 1/2 scoop in mine and I love both vanilla and chocolate !!I make a smoothie using a banana, Vanilla Almond Milk,  OR delish Dark Chocolate Almond Milk, 2 big spoons of non-fat plain yogurt, andSpinach.  Yummy and Healthy"
"After taking up pickle ball following years of no tennis or racket sports, I felt a twinge in my forearm. Years ago I had suffered from tennis elbow and wanted to nip this early.  These do the job perfectly."
"General Hux merchandise was pretty hard to come by and he's my favorite character. So I was thrilled to snatch him up online.  So if you're looking to add him to your collection, get him soon, because the General Hux merchandise prices seem to be going up and up."
I needed one place to keep track of my activities as well as those of my three busy sons.  This is the perfect planner to help me DO just that.  I have been looking for months.  I love it!!!
Being so little people reviewed and bought this I'll just do it. It's real and just like the picture.  I have yet to try it out but it's what the description/picture says. I am giving this as a gift so hopefully it'll stay great
sorry to say this is a disappointing set. shock administration is very unpredictable. It's not really needed after a jolt or two; the beeper works as a good training aid....but the unpredictable and frequently non-existent shock is awful for what I paid for it.
"This is a gorgeous dress! It looks expensive and is easily paired with anything. It is so comfortable and so classy! I wore it to my hooding ceremony under my gown in the Arizona heat and I didn’t find it annoying, itchy, or suffocating at all! I’ll wear it again!"
"Very nice looking, but out of 10 plants, 7 have come away from the base. Several arrived that way and more have come loose during routine cleaning. They are easy to fix, but it's a pain. The whole product is of a nice quality, except the glue they used."
The Adhesive-did not last very long in the showe The  Product  did not last very long in the shower  If you doctor it up it does good.$20.00 for 2 is a little much for what you get
"Great hat, but the issue is with the brim letting in light. It needs a piece of fabric on under the brim like traditional hats to block the light. I have to wear sunglasses with the hat to block the white glare coming through hat."
Nice package includes a lot of items for a Hello kitty themed party. I used part of the items and still looked great. One thing I didn’t expect is that some of the balloons read “cumpleanos feliz” instead of “happy birthday”
when i put it in the copier all it did was print a black sheet. i removed it in and out several times with no success. i went to a local store and purchased another at twice the price and it worked perfectly.
"The description says this item is water proof, it definitely isn’t. Also, it’s not comfortable to wear at all, regardless whether you try and loosen or tighten it to make it fit over the sensor, it leaves marks and hurts."
This is probably one of the most beautiful bands I have purchased! I love it. Beautiful color of blue... it’s huge I say that because I LOVE pink! But this goes well with blue jeans and work clothes! But it you will love it!!! The
"No fabric softener,  but scent booster does the trick! There's no extra reinforcement like top brand/top $$$ compression gear, but it does the job adequately. Ordered same size as T-shirt & it's snug like it's supposed to be without being tight."
"Looks very appetizing it’s not too soft not too hard kinda crumbly, it’s all organic which is nice. Definitely needs to be broken up into smaller pieces for small breeds. I love the ingredients, so far so good, gave my pups this treat last night and they all loved it."
"My cat used it a lot, it was a great addition to my cat’s toys. He used it in a verity of ways like playing, resting, and hiding. He would play and use it for a long time before getting tired."
They are the right color of purple lenses I wanted & they are very comfortable to wear. What I'm not real happy with is I wish the lense size was a little bigger like about 1/4&#34; on top & bottom as the width is perfect.
Flimsy paper very hard to turn pages or handle in high humidity. It went limp. Punches are ok. I think I will just buy a punch for the future as there is little choice in manufacturer for this style of paper.
Beautiful piece of jewelry! They don’t itch or turn your ear green! They do “hold tight” to your ear. I had to take them out after several hours. I’ll still wear them though. I’d rather them be tight than lose.
"Small, handy, easy to use.  Wish I had bought this thing sooner.... Of course, the taxi driver in Tahiti to whom I gave a $50 tip instead of a $5 tip would disagree.  I plan to buy these for all my traveling friends."
"Great assortment of animals and colors. Nice and sticky for sticking to the ceiling. We’ve had many flinger wars with the grandkids, loads of fun. A bit more fragile than some flingers,  but more than made up for in the colors and variety of animals"
"Honestly, I wouldn’t get it. It’s great in theory but it doesn’t really work in the sense that it’s fairly uncomfortable. I think it’ll only work if the size is less then 1/2 bigger, because mine is 1/2 a size bigger and would still slip off"
"It looked nice when i saw it an decided to buy it, but it's just a piece of cloth with a nice painting. No possibility to use it without a board sticking to it. We ended up not using it."
"This wrap dress is perfection!  Fits true to size, great quality for the price, is loose and comfy, but can be easily dressed up with heels or worn casually with sandals or sneakers.  Considering ordering a second one in a different color!"
"Yeah it was easy to put together, but I was sorely disappointed when I realized there was no ‘T’ or ‘O’ and instead there was a ‘Q’. What the heck? Had to put up “I’m 1 Puppers.” It’s cute, but not what I wanted and not what I paid for."
"This pattern is amazing, the shirt is well constructed, and it looks great with a pencil skirt. It looks like an expensive brand. I would size down a bit, as it was slightly bigger than I would want, but I am still extremely impressed and pleased."
It had the features I wanted but unfortunately it's just shabbily made and broke the first time I used it. Also the blade is dull. The only function I can still use my broken one for is the grinder/pulverizing function.
We were looking for a low fuzz factor in a stuffed animal so that it would be safer when the baby puts it in her mouth. This is incredibly soft and easy for the baby to hold. It is also safe for the baby.
Excellent summer time toy.  Had a few pin holes but they didn’t seem to affect the toys function. Easy to put up and take down.  Highly recommend the purchase.  Seller communicated with shipping and it even arrived earlier than expected.
"Very cute, seems well made.Update:  My cat has been wearing this collar for over a year now, and it is still super cute and holding up well.  Great product.2nd update: the collar so nice, I bought it twice.  Seriously, it's really cute."
"I loved this mousepad soooooo much, but its gets dingy SUPER fast and is really really hard to clean. I tried every trick on the internet, but could never get it as nice as it was when I first got it. :("
"Excellent transmitter, and very sturdy case. A bit of a learning curve, kinda like learning a new computer program, which is what it is! I love it! The voice and hepatic (vibrator) functions are great if you have old eyes, like I do. Worlds above the Spektrums I've been using."
I like this Harness it's better than her last one more comfortable  and breathable with  her long fur. I get a lot  of compliments  on it when we're  out  for  walks I love the bonus of a matching  collar
"Wish it would have held the lower belly in a little better and it shouldn't say &#34;back support&#34; because it really didnt support the back, maybe I was looking for a little more then what this could offer. But it did help heal my stomach and the price was great."
"I LIKE THE TOPS.  I KNOW THEY ARE SUPPOSE TO FIT TIGHT, BUT I WOULD ORDER A SIZE LARGER.  I'M 5'2 & 129 PDS.  I ORDERD A LARGE.  THEY ARE MADE OF THIN MATERIAL SO YOU CAN WEAR THEM AS A LAYER AND IT'S NOT BULKY."
"I really needed this keyboard tray when it became clear I would be working from home for a long while.  It has eased the pressure on my neck, wrist, and elbows. It's super easy to install and very sturdy. The size I bought fits my mouse and keyboard perfectly."
"Great belt, nice feel and weight. The accessory to punch hole is a plus, a huge plus. It helps me to make adjustments to other belts I have.I've even bought another for my friends mom whom he says is always wearing his belt.Thumbs up. Three if I had that many."
"The material on this bra is very soft and breathable. Although it isn't supportive, it felt comfortable enough. The straps didn't bother my damaged shoulders, or my neck. I also liked the idea I didn't feel like it was cutting into my skin."
I like the fact that the hooks for the bells are heavy and extremely well made. I have two trouble making mischievous kitties and I prefer to know where they are. Great for the money and if they happen to lose the bells I can replace them cheaply on Amazon.
"The Knee scooter I bought was a great solution for getting around after foot surgery, but the pad on the scooter was hard on my knee. This pad was thick and soft and kept my knee from getting calloused or sore. I definitely suggest!"
"I wore these as a bridesmaid in a wedding and was prepared to change early in the reception, but they were much more comfortable than I expected. I bought a half size larger than I normally wear. I got tons of compliments."
"This is a very useful little pack -- keyword: little.  My son thought it would be big enough to use as a school backpack, but it's not.  It is; however, the perfect size to wear for airplane travel, to carry on and have easy access to everything."
"I Love this gown!  I love the look of it, I love the feel of the material, I love the length of it, and it’s well made. A friend purchased my first “Secret Treasure” as a gift and I fell in love with it. I highly recommend it"
"I bought the 180 piece Rubber bands, and they work great! I can't find the ""grab the can"" bags anymore, so I needed something to keep the bags from falling inward...these fit the bill. No breakage s far, so I have a 178 spares."
"The fabric is a good weight, beautiful colors, and fits to my chosen size.  The dress was delivered within 48 hours for an occasion that came up very suddenly, and was very affordable. I highly recommend this seller and dress."
Two broke in the first few hours of wearing. I got these for my girls for the first day of school- if nervous look at the heart and remember mom has hers too- needless to say two didn’t make it home
"I was really excited to use this for my daughters first day of school. The board is very cute and sturdy, but the markets they sent with them were all dried out and none of them worked. I recommend the board, but I hope they do something about the markers."
Cute but a little too big. I was hoping that it would look a little more delicate but my fault for not checking out the measurements. Has a sturdy construction. It is a great gift item too.*I received this product at a discount in return for my honest opinion*
Not the easiest thing I've ever assembled in my life but it is done and it works perfectly.  I was amazed that it is built in China and no parts were missing and there were no extra parts either!  It would be nice is they added a drawer
"For the money it’s not gold plated, but, the handle is sturdy and thick, the head is solid metal and has just the right amount of edge to scratch and not dig. That being said I will happily use this item and update this review if it fails. 9/21"
"parts flimsy, some parts doesn't completely attach properly without forcing it in making it bend awkward in some places. The parts that's had to be forced in made the parking lot unlevel so the toy cars end up rolling away. Takes some time to attach all the stickers and parts."
For my Grandson who had to have one after my other Grandson got one.  They absolutely love them although this one comes up missing every other day because a lot of his shorts don't have a place to carry a wallet in.
Purchased as a gift for my six year old grandson  who couldn't get it out of the box quick enough and has not left it alone since! Appears to be very well made and just what my grandson wanted!
"This is a great buy!  This is a fun item for cats. Not only do my cats enjoy the scratch pad, they have fun moving the ball around. It's fun just to sit back and watch them entertain themselves, along with entertaining me!"
These are really cute! I ordered a few. I am giving my daughter a Minnie Mouse party but she really likes Mickey. These balloons match the colors in the Minnie stuff I bought. Can't wait to put it all together!
"Stuffing EVERYWHERE. Not for large dogs. Not even large pups. These only seem good for small dogs or dogs that don't chew or shred. Probably good for play and stimulation, but ours only lasted a day with our St. Bernard pup..."
"I didn't put these outside.  I have them hanging in my diningroom with my other Christmas things.  This can be put anywhere.  The material is thick enough, but not really thick.  There is no ink run."
"This is a nice, classy set. The case is beautiful and the dominos themselves look and feel like they are good quality. Dominos are great for learning math and for playing competitively. This set is nice for either kids or adults."
Oh my this is made sooo cheap! Its super tiny as expected from the description but its not attractive at all. It looks like glue all over the slates. I would not pay more then 5.00 for this thing honestly...its way over priced. Wouldn't recommend
"Good value for fresh, natural, healthy seeds. No colors, additives, or extras. My bird enjoys it & even her feathers look healthier, shinier. The only issue I find is that the zipper of the bag doesn't close, so I keep it in another ziplock bags & refrigerate for freshness."
"I am 5'4"" and 148#.  I am in between a 10 and a 8 depending on the store.  Much larger size at big box stores.  8 fit perfect.  Length was perfect to wear with flats or heals.  For the price, I would recommend."
"A perfect example of how different 200 mg. of caffeine feels depending on what brand it is and what batch it is from. This one is very weak, need to take 3 or 4 pills to feel any effect. My previously purchased Nutricost Caffeine is so much better!"
"Westher is still warm so the real test hasn't come. That said, the parts are solid and fit together well (a/t we did add some sealant at the seams). Not sure if our feral guy is using it quite yet, but we're hopeful."
"I got this as a house warming gift for the boyfriend. He's all about Star Wars and loved it on sight. It is sturdy, and looks as advertised. It compliments his décor rather than sticking out. I got 5 Cool Girlfriend Points for this one. :)"
"I just installed the replacement ribbon and it seems to be dry. The print is very faded and unreadable. I may have installed it incorrectly, but I followed the instructions and it does not print well. I do believe it is a dry ribbon."
"My puppy screamed, barked at it… tried to chew it to pieces it is very sturdy but it’s just not for my puppy dog I don’t know what she thought it was but she screamed and hollered at it so it may not be good for young puppies."
"This is the best leash I ever used. Comfortable, easy to hold, love the snaps for the handle. It has a poo bag holder built in. Only thing I do question is durability of the snaps, but right now feels excellent."
"Great size, nicely detailed. Stands up firmly. It is a bit hard and scary to fit the feet onto the stand as others reviews have said, its a tight tight fit. Lightweight but not lighter than your typical action figure."
"I thought this would be the perfect replacement for a 14"" chain (exact measurement with rings). This collar measures 15.25"" without rings and 16.25"" including rings. I can't leave it on my dog as it slips too easily over his head. Useless."
"PharmaGABAI take 1/2 of a chewable tablet at bedtime along with other sleep aids.  I split it with a small knife. I believe it helps me sleep. If I take a whole tablet, sometimes I have vivid dreams, which I don't like. So I just take 1/2 tablet."
"These cards will be useful as my child gets a little older to start learning the alphabet, words, then later the concepts.Product came with 35 total cards - more than what was stated on listing. Construction feels sturdy and holds up to handling. Good value - recommended"
"So, yes these are warm and I do use them on the coldest of days but I really don't like them because i think they are ugly. I suppose if you want them for warmth yes but if you are going for style...no way."
I bought this for my husband for his birthday because he’s “full of great ideas” and I’m not going to lie I was pretty disappointed. It’s small. Pretty underwhelming. And if it’s for great ideas you’d think there would be more room to write them down.
Love it!!! Laminating so many things. Mostly the kids school work for keepsakes. We've also made placemats and bookmarks.  It's fun to take a picture out of Ranger Rick magazine or from the dollar store and laminate it to make it really hold up!
The waist was a bit tight for my liking.  But I didn't realize it was not a full 3x.  It was 2 to 3x.  Nice thick stretchy comfortable material.  Plenty of length.  Kept me really warm on a cold northern NY day.
These reading glasses are very good quality for the amazing affordable price.  I had other brands and had to send them back because of the poor quality.  I am glad I bought these.  Thumbs up for me.
I have a second hole in my ear that I like to keep a stud in and I kept losing them because they were very loose fitting with the back and these are amazing they are not gonna fall out and now I have several colors to choose from
It’s a beautiful May & honestly I didn’t want to return it but the edges were really bothering my arms. It also seemed like it could get ruined quickly with dents or anything pressed into it but that’s the chance you take with the leather.
Great product at an affordable price. We upgraded to the larger model and we like the convenience of not having to empty it after each use. The customer service is superb. This company strives to ensure their customers are satisfied. Recommend this product and will purchase again in the future.
After assembling the puzzle I was missing one piece and the seller immediately sent me a brand new puzzle so that I could complete it. It was challenging but the letters on the back made it much easier to complete! Great puzzle!
"Given that this product is really just cornstarch, it does what it promises and keeps toys in good condition between uses. But you're mainly paying for presentation and slight convenience vs just buying cornstarch on it's own. I can imagine this would be nice for presentation in with gifts though."
Compared to other offers on Amazon there isn’t any comparison.  These pads are great. They suck up the liquid and makes my life easier.  I tried others and agree they’re like using a paper towel.  Try them you will not be disappointed.
These are good facial wipes to clean with - the stuff my dog gets in the corner of his eyes everyday. They don’t have a smell and haven’t irritated his skin or anything. I like that they are thin and just the right size- IMO.
"So hard to find clothes that fit pit bulls! These fit very well. Maybe a little long on the under side (sometimes he wets them when he pees) but otherwise very happy with fit, color, and quality. He loves to wear them and looks adorable."
"I purchased this in red,  but it is absolutely pink. There's nothing red about it.  They've changed the picture since I bought mine,  so it's a little less misleading,  but it is still very different from what I received. As a pink dress,  it's fine."
I used them on a pair of boots for noise reduction.  I was able to cut them to fit the size of the heel.Price great.  Able to solve my problem without spending a lot of money as I would have at a shoe repair shop.
Its very cute and I'm happy with the product.Only complaint is that I bought a Large size for my 20 pound shih tzu and it loosely fits her at it's tightest settings. So if you have a full-bodied &#34;small breed&#34; dog just get a medium.
"Cats love it.  Don't ask me why. A bit pricey for what it is, but trust me, there's no point in wasting money buying other cheap toys your cat will just ignore.  This is the primo cat toy."
"Worked great the first time. After the first use I noticed much less steam. After about 3 uses it started leaking out of the bottom. Now,  after about 10 uses it has stopped streaming entirely and leaks all of the water out of the bottom."
Fish came packed well(no heat packs)Did the drip acclamation and all 3 are doing well. For what I payed for and what I received are Very different ! This is no way a ( Blue turquoise). Maybe a mix but not as advertised.
"Well this is disappointing; our boys were excited about this set and started putting it together. All the parts look good; however, we are missing a bag of critical parts so the model will not be able to be completed. That is unfortunate."
"Little bag holds a lot! So far holding up to heavy everyday use (1month). Would give it 5 stars, but a little put off by the quality of the strap attachments at first.. seem cheap/flimsy. But seems to be holding up."
"These remind me of the originals, softer than other third-party replacements I've tried. Softer is said to be easier on gums.Fit and work just like the originals.Come with hard plastic covers over the heads, individually wrapped in plastic, all in a small paper box.Made in China."
"Quality memory foam , this cushion is very comfortable.. The cover is so easy to remove, and the best feature is that the cushion is made in two pieces so one may be removed if the cushion is too high."
"I bought two orders of cold weather socks.  These ones worked better for the kids who wear size 2 shoes.  The socks were too big for my son who wears a size 12.  Overall, the socks were super comfortable and warm in the cold weather."
I go this for my husband to help with his posture but the sizing was kind of off (or we where) it fits me good as a plus size woman size x2 was perfect for me but not for him who is also a bigger man (6’1 300+ pounds )
"Here's what the product looks like after a few months of wear.  It is a sandwich of printed plastic, NOT LEATHER as claimedAmazon has removed this review a number of times but the facts speak otherwise.Amazon is free to send an investigative team to verify this claim of misrepresentation."
"I purchased this for my daughter and the goggles are great she absolutely loves them. The cap on the other hand will not work for someone with shoulder length curly hair, to much puff to contain I guess. Over all we are pleased with this purchase."
They do not stick to the skin!  Useless.  Very disappointing. Finally found a bandaid to match my skin tone and it quality doesn't come close to band aids for white skin.  Do not buy. Waste of my money.
"These glasses are awesome!!! Affordable, high quality, & SUPER lightweight! I love that you can hardly feel them on your face. Love the unique shape. They are oversized which is what I prefer!Check out my YouTube channel, I made a video all about glasses from this company!@Bailey MarekInstagram: @bailey_raeee"
"I would not order unless positive cat will love, only company that does not offer returns. My cat eats everything and started leaving full cans on the plate. They do not offer returns or refunds other products do so would pass this one by."
We bought this for our (just now) 8 year old grandson. He shares with his 6 year old brother and these planes are hours of fun. They are actually better than we expected. They are sturdy and very realistic.  Wonderful toy for the money.  Would definitely buy again.
"To be quite honest, these did nothing for my Pomeranians. I even felt bad running it down their fur because I seemed as if I was hurting them. It kept getting somewhat stuck in their fur. I used them once and unfortunately never used them again."
"This is a very nice wallet, with plenty of space for credit cards etc. It has two sections to keep smaller and higher denomination bills separated which is good. This wallet is made very well with very goo leather. I would highly recommend."
Arrived damaged. The stitching is coming undone where the leg meets the body. $20 for a stuffed toy  is already a bit much but my son really wanted it. Bummed that it’s not going to last for very long.
The socks fit well and my legs felt better but the one thing they did was they made my feet smell terrible. They are not made of fibers that are not natural like nylon Lycra no real materials like cotton or wool or bamboo.
The lace is beautiful but the cardigan was sewn improperly.  One side hung longer than the other and it was way toooooo tight.  I ordered up one size.  I guess you need to order up 2-3 sizes.
Surprisingly well built double card deck holder. Holds a little more than 100 cards or two card decks. Comes with a 2 dividers to separate your card decks. If you’re looking for a quality deck holder that doesn’t break the bank this Rayvol card deck holder is for you.
"I bought a beautiful looking coller for my golden retriever and loved how it looked, but it broke in three days. I just wish they were durable and able to last and still have the same look. I wouldn't recommend this product."
These do not stick at all. They don’t even feel sticky just touching the back. They would not adhere to my shoe for me to even attempt to try them and see if they provided comfort to my heel. I will be returning.
Our dogs destroy every toy in seconds but this ball has withstood it all. It does not squeak or anything so it's not the favorite of the home but it seems to actually be indestructible. I'll update if that changes.
Use this product to hold bath toys.  Nice to store right in the tub and with the netting the waterjust drains out.  Haven't put anything super heavy in so can't speak to holding shampoo etc butfor the basics it's perfect.
"The kitties LOVE these flavors!  The size of the cans is a lot better than the small ones, if you have more than one cat to feed. I have eight of them and they like the pate type of canned food."
"Didn't work well with my Canon Printer.I was printing Line Art, and there were gaps in the image. There were also some areas that had a ""halo"" around the element of the art.I can not use these for creating a mask for Silk Screening."
I wish I could have purchased the heat lotion instead... That is what I had before and really liked it. I bought 2 bottles of the new product not knowing it was gel and it doesn't work as well as the lotion.
"I like the smaller size and the fruit theme, but the sponge stays wet too long for my taste and the possibility of mold grow on a wet sponge kinda bugs me especially since there are some health issues with my family."
"We bought this as a prop in a photo shoot. It served the purpose. Only problem we were outside on a windy day so it Kept blowing down.  But it will be perfect indoors. Cute,. Light weight but sturdy enough to sit indoors on a book self or desk."
My granddaughter fell in love with this before we got it out of the package. She dropped everything else and paid little attention to the rest of her birthday presents. It was a hit! Her mom likes that you can toss this into the washer. Great toy for a 1-year-old.
"Bought for child.  Quality seems decent but the primary purpose was for games.  Almost all the games ARE Oriental text.  Not useful.  This includes instructions,game text,etc.  Sending back and feeling foolish for this oversight in requirements"
"Everyone has different reactions to herbs and plants. This product made me starving out of my head. It was like being on steroids, I was full and still starving like I hadn't eaten all day. Oh my goodness! I will definitely not take these again."
"This is so cute, bought it for myself for my birthday because I am obsessed with corgis! The photo quality of the corgis is awesome, no blurriness or pixelated photos, will be re using for my Corgi's birthday in september :)"
"Cats love it.  I have two, and put them either in line, or side by side with the center holes matching up.  They can be connected using the elastic thingies on the ends.  Cats love the crinkliness of them too."
Sturdy construction ... BUT ... The clamp will no lose all the way ... they remain open about 1.5 in. and just flap around at full grip.  Only use is as hook.  I will return and choose another product.
"This was the poorest quality puzzle I’ve ever had. There was a piece missing, you had to flip it over to verify if pieces were put together correctly using the letters on the back because the majority just didn’t look like they fit quite right and 2 extra pieces !"
"We have a little bitty puppy and a super chewer and this toy is beloved by both! The rope part lasted barely an hour in the mouth of the big dog, but they both still play with it a ton."
The game arrived quickly and I was excited to start playing. I never could change the language on the game from German to English. I tried multiple times. I emailed customer service in Germany twice asking for help and never heard from anyone.
One of the shirts had a rip in the arm. Was disappointed so had to sew lace on the sleeves to hide the rip. Was disappointed but have a nicer shirt. My mom loved the checkered dress for her doll.
"I ordered this for my nephew, who is dealing with speech problems. That said, this arrived as described, and best of all, he loves using it. We like the shaping aspect of it, which makes it more interactive for him. We are pleased with it and recommend it."
"Bought this for my 4-year old daughter who is a ""How to Train Your Dragon"" fan.  She loves it and carries it around with her ""toothless"", playing pretend.  I don't know how Astrid would feel, but in our house his girlfriend is Fawn from Pixie Hollow."
"The bottle is smaller than I expected, and is definitely made from flexible plastic and a hobby lobby style ribbon. Itself isn't bad, it just seemed kind of cheaper and the result of a craft project. Otherwise it does the job!"
Ive tried pretty much all the blue buffalo kitten meals and my tabby likes this one the best by far. He used to eat Royal Cain alot but it has since upset his stomach.He devours this everytime so itll be our go to from now on.
Really adorable.. color is rich and pretty .  The magnates that hold each letter together are so strong you can dangle a strand of letters together in mid air and they stay together!  My granddaughters name looks so cute using these letters on her bookshelf!
These yearly calendars are my favorite. They make doing taxes every year so very easy as every month's pocket has all the paperwork for each month. I will buy continue to buy this calendar every year as there isn't a better one out there.
Love this!  Has everything I need and it designed well.  The clear pockets in the front are great too.  Has a clear plastic cover and back as well so the pages won't rip.  I use a planner daily for work and this is perfect.
"Love It! Was going to buy a full chair but couldn't afford it, thus is just as good as the chair I almost bought for $800. Try out current locations. We found one couch provided better support than another. Love it!"
"I'm not sure if WotC thinks we don't sleeve our cards, but the provided deck boxes do not support it. Unlike the Merfolk vs. Goblins duel decks, which has deck boxes that fit sleeved cards, this set requires third-party deck boxes."
"Soft chews that will not get stuck in esophogus of toy breeds. Two of mine will eat them like treats, but my 14 yr old will not. Anti-inflamatory with 250 mg of glucosamine plus vitamins. I have seen results in 2 to 3 weeks"
"We heard this was being phased out, and our friends' daughter was asking for it for her birthday.  Couldn't find it at any Target and got lucky with it on here.  It's cute, exactly as advertised, and made a little girl's day."
I’ve ran these axles for a year now and no issues at All people say they pins fall out this and that.  Loctite themProb solved.  And if you lose a pin you just have to replace the pin nothing else
"This item worked perfectly fine. I was soo happy because as a hair dresser when you find a good equipment you excited and try your best to take care of it. Sadly, I travelled and when I came back to the salon this never worked again. Smh"
"Poor quality. Easy to assemble, but not worth the money at all. Wood was split, screws keep falling out, doll furniture was rotten, some of the doll furniture was completely broken and not able to be fixed. We are returning it."
I'm is only partially lined in the front. So you end up seeing that the lining goes to just under the bust. If you get this and want to keep it you will need to remove the lining. It's truly awful.
"I had originally ordered a size medium for our unfriendly chihuahua because in other brands of dog harnesses he can wear a medium. We just decided to let our dachshund wear it, and the small fits out Chihuahua like a dream"
"I was so disappointed, they sent me the wrong size. I ordered 2 one for my 4lb dog and one for my 60lb dog and received 2 small ones. They are so soft and my small dog loves it, I was hoping my bigger dog could enjoy his as well."
"Don't be like me and fall for this website for there product. They did not work at all. I only used one and one time, because there were so uncomfortable and kept moving or sliding since they make your feet sweat."
"This Carrier arrived the next day and was perfect for taking our bunny to the vet. Easy to set up, cute, functional and at a great price. I love that it collapses so I don’t have to store a bulky crate carrier. I’m very happy with this purchase."
"I bought these for my daughter's 10th birthday party (art-themed). They are perfect! Very sturdy for what you pay for an the kids are going to love them! Large enough for an adult, but even young children can wear them too."
Used it for a 20 gallon long aquarium to use for a dual betta tank and it works great but be warned it is very see through and I used a black plastic mesh to keep my bettas from seeing each other
"You can put lipstick, small comb, etc. in the zipper section and your iphone secured under the flap.  Your drivers license or credit cards can go behind clear window.  Perfect for times when you don't want to lug around a purse."
"At first I was disappointed with the way the pens fill, but found it works well and is only slightly messy.  The ink flows well and  writes smoothly.  I would order again so I can have have assorted colors ready to use."
"Like all Bearded Bastard waxes, this one is the perfect thickness.  Easy to mold, yet holds all day.The aroma is a bit coffee strong, but not too bad.  The maple seems to last the longest into the day.I will buy this again."
"Cute earrings in a great green color, I bought them to go with a beaded pendant I bought and they are vey fun. They are a little longer than I wanted , but I only wear for an evening out."
These are a perfect fit for our home and even though I had to order more than I needed they are wrapped in plastic for storage.  The price was great too considering what the a/c guy charge you for them.
Pros:100% cotton (as advertised); soft breathable material (appears to be thicker jersey material)Full coverageTrue to sizeCons:Not underwired as advertisedSmells bad (as if stored in an old dusty warehouse) but not dirty or otherwise damaged. Nothing that a single wash can’t cure.Unfortunately returning it as I specifically wanted underwired.
"Seems to work fine. I don't notice any miraculous difference in my overall health or indigestion problems taking these compared to other probiotics I've taken. I feel like the pearls I tried a while back helped my indigestion the most, but it's hard to compared."
"These cables will not fit my TENS unit, specifically the lead plug that would be inserted into the TENS unit.  After contacting the company who shipped them to me, I was given instructions to make a shipping label to return the cables for credit."
"This is probably my favorite oil outside the Everyday Oils. I wanted to try it and fast, so I ordered on Amazon.  I use it topically on areas that are inflamed or hurting, plus take it internally.  This oil is an amazing oil for anti-inflammatory concerns."
"I loved this product! It worked out perfectly for my project. The only negative I would say is the glue dots did not stick as well as anticipated, but I was able to staple the top of the light around the string."
Very unhappy with this product. 4 days after return window is closed and the lamp stops working and I can't even get the bulb out to checked the lamp or use a different lamp temporarily. Never ever will I purchase this brand or seller again.
TOO SMALL FOR NOW BUT LOVE THE COLOR AND PATTERN BUT YOU ALSO SENT 2 OF THEM I DONT KNOW WHY I ONLY ASK FOR JUST1. I WILL TRY TOO SEND THER OTHER BACK. SEND THE RETURN ADDRESS PACKET PLEASE SO I CAN SEND THIS OTHER BACK.
We use these letterboard characters and letters on our letterboard and love them. They are a bit of a hassle to cut off the attaching plastic when they arrive (that's the case with most letters/characters for letterboards). We love having the emojis and variety of characters to choose from.
"Was thick and study, made of wood. The quality was great, my only problem was, every piece shape was almost alike making it harder to put together, like even if it didn't go together it still latch on like it was the perfect piece."
Purchased an Epure duo 2 years ago. Very satisfied until the second station ac adapter failed.  I need to purchase a new one but cannot get a response from the emails sent through the swissvoice website. Does anyone have any email addresses?  USA.
"They are about 4 inches long , Toby is fussy but likes these . They harden up quickly but it doesn't bother him. I'm not sure the cost is fair but nothing is these days. Toby would say they are worth it and that is what matters."
"Seems to provide a nice, subtle calming to help with sleep, calm anxiety, or soothe the jitters if I’ve had a little too much coffee in a day—but without any heavy drowsy feeling, just a nice calm. I always keep chamomile on hand and will repurchase this brand."
This was just the right size for one action figure. It's not super sturdy but all it need to do is sit on a shelf and keep the dust off the figure. It is the equivalent of those plastic covers you get for paperbacks. Not pricy but effective.
My dog used this pool for the 1st time and after she got out I noticed about 10 holes in the bottom of the pool from her nails this is not a good pool to buy for a pet it is not a very durable at all
"initially i bought size 4 in pink according to the size description. i really love it but sadly it is too small. So i bought some other color in size 6, it fits me ok, but  the coats stink like  wet dog. I need to return."
"These eggs are larger than your average plastic egg. The gold covering doesn't seem like it would chip off too easily, and the two parts connect nicely. How exciting to have some shiny, large gold eggs within the regular plastic ones at Easter!"
Every one of the bracelets were broken in several pieces on arrival. I managed to put one back together well enough to serve my original purpose as a gift. the others sit in a bag waiting for me to have time to try and rescue them.
I have been using this sunscreen since the beginning of summer and living in Cali you really have to make sure your skin is protected. As an experienced esthetician  the ingredients in this product are not only organic but the best to protect you from the skin.
"Perfect for the price! These chokers are being sold for $15 a piece at the boutiques around here. They were quite bent after taking them out of the packaging, but I took my straightener out and had them straight in just a few minutes. Very pleased for the price."
Really great quality product! I was also impressed with how well the board was packed when it arrived. I had to contact the seller (Franklin Creative Solutions) for a very minor problem and they replied in minutes and went above and beyond to assist me! Highly recommend 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
My only issue was that they are so thin and flat it feels like you barely got any lol But there were 3 strings with 10 panels medium size. They are pretty and worked well for my Mexican themed party.
"These boots run extremely small. I had purchased a size 4 for my older daughter and ended up giving them to my younger daughter who is a size 1.5. That said, order at least 2 sizes up. It's a nice sturdy boot with a nice price tag."
"The only food my tortoise loves!  Easy to fix, takes about 5 minutes to make.  I add a few other items for taste (grapes, strawberries) and he gets a totally healthy meal.  Don’t have to grocery shop for lettuce every few days."
I know the owners for many many years and they are very trustworthy andYou’re standing to your needs and your budget I will not push you or force you to do anything you don’t want to do there always a pleasure to deal with.
"Listen, you aren't going to find such a cute ring for less than five dollars anywhere!  I already bought one of these for myself about six months ago and loved it so now for Christmas I'm getting one for my daughter... It's perfect for her!"
The set is beautiful and I looked forward to wearing them. I've worn ear cuffs for years but never had a problem like this. They just don't stay on my ear. I think the wrap portion is too small to hold to the ear.
"I'm a jewelry designer and use these labels all the time.  I usually get the elephant ones, but did not see them here.  these are very difficult to write on.  would not ""take"" the ink.  rough surface and disappointing."
"Well made item, mine had a broken zipper that I was able to fix with my tools. It looked a bit more masculine than I would have liked so it was a perfect gift for my brother that travels a lot."
"Do not waste your money on this product. I saw all of the great reviews and thought that I’d give it a try, but only to find out that I completely wasted my money. I purchased for chalazions and it’s still here."
"This thing Blows! I bought it thinking it would be an inexpensive answerer.Only problem is, it DOES NOT ANSWER THE CALLS!I returned it and got another, and the new one DID NOT ANSWER THE CALLS EITHER!Lets review; Someone calls--------it DOES NOT ANSWER!This phone BLOWS!"
"I'll preface by saving Amazon has been a godsend for me. Pre- surgical and not so easy to get out and shop. Whatever I need, I buy it on Amazon. No fuss. I have Prime and it shows up a day or two later. Cards are exactly what I needed."
"I  got the whole set of the Star Trek Next Generation, it's very well made I still have it in it's box not  sure if I will open it or not. Love my purchase and it was  great deal."
"Great way to wash your back. Really gets the soap on and scrubs it. Plenty long enough. Easy to hold and use. Well made, thick rubber handles. Comes with a mount to hang in your shower. Cleans off easily. Dries quickly."
"I use these as Bible journals. They are the perfect size, slim and beautiful.  The paper's ""tooth"" is excellent. Try using the new Sharpie S gel pen .05- you will love it . These are lovely.  Delivered early- thanks!"
They were very cute but I ordered a size 2 and they were way too small for my daughter and she wears a 2 in all her other shoes. I think they run one size smaller than what it is.
This was recommended to me by a friend whose dog also seemed to be allergic to most other dog food options.  Found that putting fish oil on it made it a bit more palatable.  My dog is fussy but he definitely does better on this stuff.
"Junk. Won’t lay flat, the perimeter stitching causes it to bunch up. Defeats the whole purpose of the mat. Can’t recommend. Too much of a hassle to return so I’ll be throwing it away. Upside, it was only eight bucks."
"I’m happy to have found this adorable and affordable dog bed for our sofa. My two mini dachshunds love to wrestle and snuggle on it. It’s so cozy for them, and a huge plus that I can also wash it!"
"I haven't bought a mat for hard floor before, and they are much thinner than the kind for carpet. In my case that's kinda a bummer 'cause I have carpet but on the other hand, it's much easier to roll up since I move often. So far it's working fine."
These were perfect for our trunk or treat. These are NOT for children under 3 as they may try to eat the bouncy ball which is a choking hazard.  My grandson loved playing with the ones I had left over.
"I bought this thinking my insulin needed to be refrigerated when I first became diabetic , but it can be out 30 days. Kwickpens are also way better. I’m currently using this to pack my babies food so it can be useful."
The description of this hoodie is WRONG! I'm a XL/1X and I purchased a 3X in this hoodie and it is too SMALL. Would have returned but I gave it to a little girl. The quality is also poor. I would NOT recommend purchase of this hoodie.
If I could of given zero stars I would have. I definitely didn’t receive the 9” laminator as it say in description. I received a tiny thin black silicone ring the size of a dime. Definitely would NOT purchase this item unless you want to be disappointed like I was.
I usually wear crocs for ease of stepping into them with their specialist level for comfort. I was excited to try this shoe for ease and for support. Check check. And they are so cute. Plan to appear more stylish when ever I can step out in the future
"This product ranks in the best of UVA/UVB sunscreens. And it doesn't disappoint. I exclusively use this now. It doesn't clog my pores, isn't greasy, never makes me sweat or greasy like other sunscreens and it's not tested on animals."
"Works great, scent is not over whelming like other sports rubs and seems to lessen after a few hours . I have a slew of neck and back problems and this helps a lot. I will say I use it very sparing due to the high cost."
"Figure arrived on-time, but was packed in so tightly with others that display boxes were destroyed/non-usable.One figure was so warped from packing that it cannot stand on its own, and since box is destroyed it cannot be displayed without support from another object."
"These were ordered as spare parts for my plane. They are a few of the parts I haven't yet broken!  My first attempt with rc flying has been bumpy. My order came promptly,  well packed - all the good stuff. I'm happy"
This does make me more aware of my posture to stand up straight which is what I bought it for. It fits well but the armpits rub and it starts to hurt so have to wear it over a shirt so I can't wear it to work.
"I directed a large musical and was able to gift these with 4 favorite song titles on the pencil attached to my card to each child. The pencils arrived quickly, were great quality and added a special touch to the occasion!"
I like that there's no monthly subscription but slower ins and outs if using keypad.  Fingerprint is super fast though.  Keypad requires very deliberate pushing and I don't expect the buttons and paint to stand up too well against our guys.
"This Bath Bomb Gift Set has a variety of fragrances. Each bath bombs come in individual packing which makes them easier to carry anywhere. They are full of lovely moisturizing ingredients.These are very nice, quite large bath bombs. These are perfect for gifting too."
"These are not as big as they say they are. I think they are about 1/8"" smaller than they say and that makes a big difference when filtering.  I notice cat hair in the bottom of the fountain when I've cleaned it since using these new filters."
"Received this as a present 3 years ago for my dog.  I purchased a replacement so once her original finally wears out, she'll have a new one.  It is her favorite toy yet has lasted so long it is unbelievable!"
This product has great potential and initially the kittens thought it was fun.  There is absolutely no way that the rug will stay up.  It just flops down and that's it.  Save 39.99 and let your kittens play with boxes.
"I purchased these and a substantial hard cover for my planner.  The rings/ covers needed a bit if breaking in, but it's been great!  Professional and sturdy! I highly recommend the larger size rings with a hard cover for the happy planner!"
ok so the quality isnt 100% but this is perfect for the box of business cards i've had for over 15 years...hopefully it doesnt fall apart because i bought a second one as i still have a few more cards...
"The lament wasn't expected or the fact both behave a backside of the other/both are double sided,But they are nice enough and although I'd prefer a matte finish or just paper I'd say these will most likely last me a lot longer than paper so I'm fine."
"First off, they stole photos from the Free People website. This is an extremely cheap version of the original. Second, the fabric is cheap and it smelled horrible when out of the packaging. I didn’t even bother trying it on before returning it."
These are very warm. I love that you can detach the bib from the pants itself. They are windproof and do not get wet when you are out in the elements for extended periods.  Highly recommend these snow pants for anyone that lives in below zero climates.
"My niece loved this toy after flying on an airplane.  One of the engines broke off, but in a way that super glue can fix it.  Really wish it came with an on/off switch especially since the button is so prominent and gets bumped easily in bags."
"Really great for my 2.5 and 5 year old. But be aware, these do NOT work with the Perler biggie beads. Mass frustration will occur if you try and have them mix on the same square board that comes with this box!"
This set is so adorable and its my favorite color!  It's very easy to use. the bowls attaches to the sides. Easy grab and go so your fury baby will have food and water on the go. Items are just as pictured.
I like these sticks for my dogs. They do not have a bad strong smell. They are quickly chewed up by my dogs but the bag is full and has a lot of product in it. They are not messy and my dogs love them.
It took my dog a minute to start using this but she does now and it is a perfect size for her and it looks fine in the living room. It also provides good storage for her toys and brushes to clean the couch.
This was a blast to put together. My 9 yo is reading Fellowship and we had so much fun working out where pieces should go based on names. The little insets of different scenes around middle earth was a nice touch. Those were faster to put together- start with those
"I like this blood pressure reader. It talks to you, that is what I like the most. What I mean by, it talks to you, I mean, when you put it on and press the go button, it tells you to relax and be still basically. I like it"
"Loved the 61 card rare pack. And you also get a nice hard case that's clear, you could customize it with a design and make a custom deck box out of it. I think it's a bonus gift :) I definitely will continue to order products from Cosmicgamingcollections"
Have a very picky 10 month of mega mix puppy who also has a sensitive tummy.We finally found a kibble that worked for him but he wouldn’t eat it plain. Then I found Alpha Chef. My pup loves the chicken blend!!!
"My 2 and half year old son loves it. He already knew the song. And days when he is in no brush mood, the song on this brush makes me feel happy and gets him started on brushing. Awesome product"
When I purchased this item I thought it came in the spray bottle but it doesn't. They should really change the picture on the item. I used a spray bottle from the Dollar Store and it cleans my wood burning stove glass perfectly.
"This is a cute outfit and for the price, you can't go wrong.  It fit 2 different types of 18 &#34; dolls with no problems.  The kids really like having a lot of outfits for their dolls and the price is right, quality is satisfactory."
"THIS PRODUCT TASTES AWFUL.  THE CONTAINER WAS HARD TO OPEN AND ONCE INSIDE IT IS TO SMALL OF AN AMOUNT TO GARGLE THE PRODUCT WAS EXPIRED BY 3 YEARS. IT WAS YELLOW, SMELLED DISGUSTING...... I DID GET A PROMPT REFUND AND THAT WAS GOOD."
This harness is so funny. My dog doesn't like to wear costumes but since he is used to a leash harness he will wear this. When he has it on and starts running the horseman bobs like it is actually on a horse! Hilarious!
"Had it less than a week, but seems to be fine.  Like the large, back-lit numbers (good for old eyes) and the lack of need to zero the scale prior to use.  No real way to assess the accuracy."
"love it but led started to come and go dim whenever if feels like it after only 1 month of use of it.  Must of got a diffective one, other than that really nice mouse pad for the price, and hey it's acrylic glass.  Would buy again."
i give a 4 because I had to add an additional support in the center due to my cats weight tipping it when the jumped on and off. after that was fixed .. there is always a cat on there.
These insoles did not work for me.  My feet hurt when I tried to walk on them.  They run small and would be too small for men’s size US 11 shoe. I had to remove mine from my shoes.
Toothpaste clinic is an opening for me.  I heard about it by chance and decided to try it.  Now I can hardly use another paste.  It's not overly minty and cleans your teeth perfectly.  Expensive.  four stars
"Most cats, like mine, will not eat prescription cat food. The vet recommended the Pro Plan diet for kidney function, which Calli needs. She actually likes it! I feel better knowing I’m giving her food that will help to keep her kidneys functioning with a low protein food."
"This is great to go in your morning smoothies.  This does not change the texture of the shake and that’s what i love most about it. I haven’t tried it just plain, so i can’t say what the taste alone is like."
"Super cute, but I ordered the 7, for my skinny 8 year old and it was way too small.  The tag in the top actually said 6 and the tag in the bottoms said 7, but both were small, so returning for the size 9 hoping it works."
"All my dogs have loved these.  Not sure why folks complain about getting them out. Just follow instructions, which say to take the bone mold out of the freezer and let it sit on the counter for two minutes.  Then a slight twist makes them pop out."
"I used them instead of the smaller ones that came with the printer. They work great.At least they did for my Christmas letter.Since then, black is no longer printing.Color seems to be okay. I have not tried a different black to see if it will work better."
This does not stay together at all. I was hoping for a cage to transport our crabs during vacation and the clips do not stay clipped and the whole thing falls apart the minute you touch it. I do not recommend it.
"Loved the bright colors that go with almost every outfit! They are medium weight, but don’t pull much on the ear. The backs are tight enough to help the earrings stay put. I have very sensitive ears and had no problem wearing these all day."
"I have no idea what kind of face this was designed for, seriously. The mask is like...sideways. The mouth is all the way over to one side, theres no defined chin area, and its impossible to fasten this to fit without altering it in some way.DIY project? Maybe?"
"When I originally ordered these, I thought I was only buying three puzzles. To my pleasant surprise, especially after paying for shipping as a Prime member, I received 12 - four of each! They're exactly as pictured, perfect for party favors or just to mess with."
I was so happy that my package arrived so quickly. I'm a new fan of Oneus so I'm collecting all of their albums. This one is amazing. The packaging was great as well. Seems like everything is in good shape.
"This is NOT for XS dogs! I bought this for my handicap dog and it doesn't fit! Would like a refund, can't return it because my poor dog peed on it because he has no control of his bladder! I repeat not for xs dogs!"
"Like tech decks but not. My kids will love these (they don't know what tech decks are). I know they'll use the pieces for way more than just skateboarding fingers. Packaged very nicely and everything fits perfectly into the box, so easy to wrap for Christmas!"
Waste of money.  It’s tiny & looks like something you would buy at dollar tree.  Definitely not worth anywhere near $49.  Maybe a couple dollars.  If I had paid full price I would have been furious.
"This thing is enormous. If you’re smaller, even the small will fall down. There is no way to make it work without safety pins or sewing it smaller. Bummer. If you’re crafty enough it’s worth the price to give it a go."
"Not a smooth feeling. Guess I'm just used to a better quality pen. would not order again. Good enough if you had to write a quick note. Perfect to be left out in public place, (and hope someone steals it!)"
"I pack shoeboxes for Operation Christmas Child and bought these for the toothbrushes I include in all my boxes.  The holders don't stay closed very well, but the quality is still pretty good and I think they are great for the shoeboxes. I would buy these again."
"This is a light weight scarf. It's not as soft as I would prefer, but it's not scratchy or rough either. Because of the jersey fabric, I would say this is for more casual outfits and not for dressier occasions."
"They're a cute accessory. Functional for regular use in snow, not so much. Also arrived with loose threads.If you just want cute boots just to be in the cold and damp, like shoveled sidewalks, these would probably suffice but could still get damp in a puddle or wet snow."
It adheres to the fridge w/ out a problem and it cleans nicely as well. My only issue is it came a bit wrinkled. As it’s been on the fridge it has smoothed out a bit but I can still see a few kinks in it.
The papers and envelopes are a very nice thickness. The illustration are really beautiful botanical prints!Nice for sending letters. The envelopes need to be taped or glued as they have no adhesive on them. but no problem for me. I am so happy to find such gorgeous and unique stationary.
They were not as big as I would genus but they are very cool. The cards are about the size of a listerine bottle of mouthwash. The set arrived with all five cards none of which were damaged. Great present for anyone who likes Pokémon. 10/10 would recommend.
"The chain part seems sturdy, but the clip that attaches to the collar has a permanent gap in it.  My dog got off of it and almost got run over.  I have attached another type of metal clip to the chain so that I can use it. Disappointed."
"Nice size, nice leather, nice compartments.  It fits a small bag with a low profile.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because when all the card slots are used, the snap has trouble staying snapped.  But I really like it."
"Super cute. Fits true to size. I ordered a small because I was worried they’d be big, but I should have gotten a medium because they’re just a little bit small. It was my own fault though, and I still wear them because they’re so cute."
"I liked the bracelet. The words on the green pieces were extremely hard to read. I think the price was too high. $12 -$15.00 would be more reasonable. Item arrived on time and was in a gift box, which I appreciated."
"I use the Epson 3880 mainly for b/w, size A2 printsI use quality paper from Epson (the wonderful Velvet Fine Art) and I love the Canson Baryta.The Advanced b/w photo mode is outstanding.The Image Quality of the 3880 is very hard to beat."
"As others have stated, these are very thin compared to the Avery brand. There’s nothing WRONG with them per say, just not as easy to get a handle on if you marked a spot in a book that you want to open again."
"Purchased 6 Squishmallows for Christmas gifts and all the kids were going crazy; these are the softest, squishiest pillow/toys on the market.  This small one for a baby and larger ones for bigger kids; you can't go wrong with a genuine Kelly Toy Squishmallow!"
